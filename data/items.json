From parodying the banality of open-world games with 2007’s No More Heroes to collaborating with James Gunn for 2012’s pulpy Lollipop Chainsaw, his games often offer a welcome reprieve from soulless, half-a-billion-dollar-budget gaming blockbusters. It was with considerable excitement that I fired up Suda’s first new game in 10 years.\nThe game kicks off with a slick cartoon that shows our hero, Romeo Stargazer, being eaten by a zombie. Hastily resurrected by his zany scientist grandfather, Romeo returns from the brink imbued with new powers – and then we’re off. Almost immediately I am bombarded by an impenetrable wall of proper-noun nonsense. It’s like this for the next 20 hours.\n Continue reading...",

    "pubDate": "Tue, 10 Feb 2026 14:00:00 +0000",
    "source": "Engadget is a web magazine with obsessive daily coverage of everything new in gadgets and consumer electronics",
    "summary": "It takes time for novel designs to catch on. But even so, I am still wondering why the Zenbook Duo hasn't had a bigger impact on the market after ASUS released its first true dual-screen laptop two years ago. Notebooks like these provide the kind of screen space you'd typically only get from a dual monitor setup, but in a much more compact form factor that you can easily take on the road. It could be that people were wary of an unfamiliar design, shorter battery life or buying a first-gen product — all of which are understandable concerns. However, now that ASUS has given the ZenBook Duo a total redesign for 2026, the company has addressed practically all of those barriers to entry while making it an even more convincing machine for anyone who could use more display space. Which, in my experience, is pretty much everyone.\nEditor’s note: The 2026 ASUS Zenbook Duo is expected to be available for pre-order sometime in late February, with general availability slated for March. \n\nDesign\nFor the new model, ASUS didn't mess with the laptop's basic layout too much. Instead, the company polished and tightened everything up, resulting in a system that weighs about the same (3.6 pounds) while reducing its overall size (12.1 x 8.2 x 0.77 to 0.92 inches) by five percent. Critically, you still get a built-in kickstand on the bottom and a detachable keyboard that you move wherever you want. There’s also a decent number of ports, including two USB-C with Thunderbolt 4, one USB-A 3.2 jack, HDMI 2.1 and a combo audio port. That said, I do wish ASUS had found room for an SD card reader of some kind, though given the Zenbook Duo's unique design, I get why that didn't make it. \nOne of the Zenbook Duo's most important design upgrades is a new \"hideaway\" hinge that reduces the gap between the laptop's two screens. Not only does this make the laptop easier and more pleasant to use in dual-screen mode, it also allows the entire system to lay flat on a table, which is nice for drawing or sharing your screen with someone sitting opposite you. Unfortunately, while my review unit didn’t come with one, ASUS says its forthcoming Pen 3.0 will come bundled with the Zenbook Duo in the US, so you won’t need to pay extra for it. \nAnother small but appreciated improvement is the new pogo pins below the lower display, which provides a more secure and reliable way of keeping the laptop's detachable keyboard topped up. In my experience, even after running multiple rundown tests that completely drained the Duo's battery, I never had to charge up the keyboard on its own. It was always smart enough to sip electricity from the main system in the background, though it also has a built-in USB-C port for power just in case. On the flipside, if you're not scared of typing on glass, you can still use the lower screen as a keyboard and touchpad, or as a place to display widgets for news, the weather, performance and more. \nDisplays\nThe standout feature on the Zenbook Duo continues to be its dual displays, and now for 2026, they look better than ever. Both OLED panels have a 144Hz refresh rate with a 2,880 x 1,800 resolution while also covering 100 percent of the DCI-P3 spectrum. And while its nominal brightness of 500 nits for SDR content is just OK, ASUS makes up for that with peaks of up to 1,000 nits in HDR. And to make both screens even more enjoyable, ASUS managed to shrink the size of their bezels down to just 8.28mm. That's a reduction of 70 percent compared to the previous model, so now there's even less getting in the way of you utilizing these screens to their fullest.\nPerformance\nThe Zenbook Duo can be configured with a range of new Intel Core Ultra 7 and Core Ultra 9 processors, including the X9 388H chip used on our review unit. For general use and productivity, the laptop is super smooth and responsive, though that shouldn't be a surprise coming from Intel's latest top-of-the-line mobile CPU. However, for those seeking max performance, some of the benchmark numbers aren't quite as impressive as you might expect. That’s because ASUS has limited the Duo's TDP (thermal design power) to 45 watts — which is shy of the chip's 80-watt turbo power limit.\nIn PCMark 10, the Zenbook Duo only managed a score of 7,153 compared to 9,651 from a Dell XPS 14, despite the latter having a lower-tier Intel Core Ultra X7 358H processor. That said, in other tests like Geekbench 6, the Duo had no trouble staying on top with a multicore score of 17,095 versus 9,651 for the Dell. \nAnother pleasant surprise is that because the Duo's chip comes with Intel's upgraded Arc B390 integrated GPU, this thing has plenty of oomph to game on, let alone edit videos or other similar tasks. In Elden Ring at 1,920 x 1,200, the Zenbook maintained a relatively stable framerate between 55 and 60 fps on high settings, which is great considering this thing doesn't have discrete graphics. This means as long as you don't mind fiddling with game options a bit, you should be able to play newer AAA games without too much trouble. \nBattery life\nYou'd think a laptop with two displays would be super power hungry. However, by increasing the capacity of its cell from 75WHrs to 99WHrs, ASUS has made the Zenbook Duo's endurance (or lack thereof) a complete non-issue. On PCMark 10's Modern Office rundown test, the laptop lasted 18 hours and 33 minutes in single-screen mode. Granted, that's nearly four hours less than what we got from MSI's Prestige 14 Flip AI+, but considering that's the longest-lasting notebook we've ever tested, I'm not bothered. When compared to ASUS' own Zenbook A14 (18:16), things are basically a wash, which I think is a win for the Duo, as the A14 is meant to be an ultralight system with an emphasis on portability and longevity. \nObviously, battery life takes a hit when you're using both displays. However, when I re-ran our battery test with its two displays turned on, the Duo still impressed with a time of 14:23. This is more than enough to give you the confidence to set this thing up in dual-screen mode even when an outlet isn't close at hand. Thankfully, for times when you do need a power adapter, the charging brick on ASUS' cable is rather compact, so it's not a chore to lug it around. \nWrap-up\nI'm a believer that one day people will eventually embrace typing on screens with laptops just like they have for smartphones. However, even if you're not willing to make that jump just yet, the Zenbook Duo still has all of its bases covered. Its detachable keyboard gives you a pleasant experience while freeing up the bottom of the notebook to be a second display. This allows you to have something similar to a traditional dual-monitor desktop but in a chassis that you can easily take on the road without any major compromises. \nThe 2026 Zenbook Duo combines a compact design with strong performance, plenty of ports and surprisingly good battery life. Sure, it's a touch heavier than a typical 14-inch laptop, but its two screens more than make up for a little added weight and thickness. That leaves price as the Duo's remaining drawback, and starting at $2,100 (or $2,300 as reviewed), it certainly isn't cheap. \nHowever, when you consider that a similarly equipped rival like a Dell XPS 14 costs just $50 less for a single screen, that price difference is rather negligible. Alternatively, if you opt for a more affordable ultraportable and then tack on a decent third-party portable monitor, you're still likely looking at a package that costs between $1,500 and $1,800. Plus, that setup is significantly bulkier and more annoying to carry around. So while the Zenbook Duo might be an unconventional pick right now, it has all the tools to deliver unmatched portable productivity and I don’t think it will be too much longer until the masses catch on.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/asus-zenbook-duo-2026-review-two-screens-really-are-better-than-one-140000982.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "The peak time for deals on streaming services — the holiday shopping season — has come and gone, but Disney is back with a fresh offer for the new year. New and eligible returning subscribers can get one month of the ad-supported Disney+ Hulu bundle for just $10. That's $3 off the usual monthly rate for the bundle, and more than 58 percent off if you consider the prices for each service individually (Disney+ at $12 per month and, separately, Hulu also at $12 per month).\n \nWe'd be remiss if we didn't mention that this isn't quite as good as the Black Friday deal we saw last year, which offered the same bundle for $5 per month for one year. However, if you missed that offer or just want to try out Disney+ and Hulu for a brief period of time, this is a good way to do so.\n \n\n \n \nDisney+ and Hulu make one of the most balanced streaming pairs available, blending family-friendly favorites with acclaimed originals and network TV staples. Disney+ brings a vast library of animated classics, blockbuster franchises and exclusive content from Marvel, Pixar, Star Wars and National Geographic. It’s the place to stream nearly every Star Wars film and series, plus the full Marvel Cinematic Universe lineup and Disney’s most recent theatrical releases.\n \nHulu balances things out with a more adult-oriented lineup of current TV shows, next-day network episodes and a growing roster of award-winning originals. The platform hosts series like The Bear, The Handmaid’s Tale and Only Murders in the Building, alongside comedies, thrillers and documentaries that regularly feature in awards conversations. It’s also the home for next-day streaming of ABC and FX shows, making it especially useful if you’ve already cut the cable cord but still want to keep up with primetime TV.\n \nThe Duo Basic bundle ties these two services together under a single subscription, offering a simple way to expand your library without juggling multiple accounts. This tier includes ads on both platforms, but the trade-off is significant savings compared with paying for each service separately. For many households, that’s an acceptable compromise when it means access to such a wide range of content.\n \nFollow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/disney-and-hulu-deal-get-one-month-of-the-bundle-for-10-192814395.html?src=rss",

Also: This is my favorite Linux distro of all time - and I've tried them allWith 6.19, the 6.x line ends on .19, mirroring the 3.x and 5.x series before the project increments to 4.0, 6.0, and now 7.0. Mind you, Torvalds confirmed that the next kernel after 6.19 will be branded Linux 7.0, not because of any major upgrades, but because \"I'm getting to the point where I'm being confused by large numbers (almost running out of fingers and toes again), so the next kernel is going to be called 7.0.\" What's included in Linux 6.19?What Linux 6.19 brings to the table is initial support for Intel's linear address‑space separation (LASS). This hardware feature is designed to enable operating systems to block side-channel security exploits, such as the infamous Meltdown and Spectre security holes. LASS achieves this block by more strictly isolating kernel and user memory to mitigate speculative execution and privilege‑escalation attacks. The release also adds support for Arm's Memory System Resource Partitioning and Monitoring (MPAM), giving system software more control and visibility over memory and cache usage on high‑end Arm platforms. Also: 5 Linux servers that let you ditch the public cloud and reclaim your privacy - for freeIn addition, the new kernel introduces a new listns() system call that lets userspace enumerate Linux namespaces directly. This capability is expected to be useful for container tooling and orchestration frameworks that need to inspect isolation boundaries. Linux 6.19 further reworks the restartable sequences implementation, a low‑level mechanism used by threading libraries to optimize per‑CPU operations, to improve robustness and performance under contention. For file systems, the popular Ext4 now supports larger block sizes and smarter handling of POSIX Access Control Lists (ACL) checks. This approach reduces unnecessary permission lookups in directories with many files. The net result can be up to 50% improvements in file reads. In real life, though, you're much more likely to see a far more modest speed boost. Also: Why even a US tech giant is launching 'sovereign support' for Europe nowKernel networking code also benefits from a redesigned transmit‑path locking scheme that replaces a busy lock with a lock‑less list in heavy transmission (TX) workloads. In theory, you can achieve a fourfold increase in network throughput. In practice, though, you'll also see that kind of speed boost in AI and machine learning clusters, not in your next World of Warcraft raid. On the desktop side, Linux 6.19 ships significant updates for AMD graphics. These updates include compatibility improvements for older Radeon HD 7000‑era GPUs via the modern AMDGPU driver stack and better Vulkan support through the open‑source RADV driver. Benchmarks from early testers show that some older AMD GPUs can achieve 30% to 40% performance gains on certain workloads compared with previous kernels. So, if you still have 2012 AMD graphics, you're in luck. You'll see a real speed boost. The release also incorporates expanded High Dynamic Range (HDR) support through the DRM color pipeline API. This capability enables hardware‑accelerated high‑dynamic‑range output on supported displays and GPUs. Also: My proven way to speed up Linux when RAM upgrades aren't worth it (and it's free to do)Beyond graphics, Linux 6.19 tightens integration with the latest Intel and AMD processors. This move continues the steady march of enablement work for RISC‑V and other emerging hardware architectures, reflecting the kernel's growing role in heterogeneous data center and embedded deployments. The real improvements in this release are for business and cloud administrators. The most important of these improvements is the Live Update Orchestrator (LUO). LUO is designed to coordinate kernel updates with minimal disruption to running virtual machines (VMs). It works by treating a live update as a controlled reboot into a new kernel. In other words, you can reboot your server while your VMs keep running. Instead of tearing everything down, LUO preserves the state of chosen userspace objects and critical devices, handing that state to the new kernel. While LUO is primarily designed for cloud and virtualization servers, where you want to update the hypervisor kernel without dropping running VMs or losing in‑memory state, it is explicitly workload‑agnostic. LUO can also be used for other high-uptime services. I expect LUO to be adopted quickly by most cloud providers. Linux 6.19 also adds encrypted communication between PCIe devices and VMs. This link strengthens defenses against snooping or tampering on the bus in multi‑tenant environments. Together with the new Intel memory isolation capabilities and Arm MPAM support, these changes underline a release that quietly leans into security and resource control. What comes next with Linux 7.0?Immediately after 6.19's debut, Torvalds opened the merge window for Linux 7.0 and noted that dozens of pull requests were already lined up and ready for review. Some work has already started on GPU drivers, expanded display support for Intel and Qualcomm platforms, broader sensor monitoring (including new Asus motherboard telemetry), and further refinements to virtualization and live‑update paths. Also: 5 of the easiest, quickest Linux distros to install - and I've tried them allDistributions are expected to begin integrating Linux 6.19 into development branches in the coming weeks, with some rolling‑release systems likely to pick it up first as vendors test the new kernel against their hardware stacks and userland tooling. The first Linux distro expected to ship the newest kernel is Fedora Rawhide, the distribution's development branch.

    "summary": "Last year the UK declared that Apple and Google were a duopoly with \"strategic market status\" in the mobile platforms market, making them subject to special regulations. However, the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) will not regulate Google and Apple's app stores like the EU has done. Rather, government plans to enforce its own digital markets rules in a \"pragmatic\" way by accepting \"commitments\" from Apple and Google in areas like app rankings, the CMA announced. \nGoogle and Apple agreed to work with the CMA to address concerns on the following matters: app review, app ranking, use of data and interoperability process. Effectively, regulators require the tech giants to treat developers fairly, particularly when they compete against Google and Apple's own apps. However, the UK's rules are more like suggestions and \"not legally binding in any case,\" former CMA director Tom Smith told the Financial Times.\n\nThis is in stark contrast to Europe's Digital Markets Act, which forced Apple to make changes to open up iOS features and data to rivals, allow app installations from outside its Store and reduce fees collected on purchases. \nThat could change if the companies fail to comply with its measures, though. The CMA plans to check metrics like the number of apps approved or rejected, app review times and developer complaints received. New requirements could then be brought forward if deemed necessary. \"For example, if we find Apple is routinely declining interoperability requests without good reason... we could bring forward specific interoperability requirements. Non-compliance would also mean we would be unlikely to consider commitments as a similar approach in [the] future.\"\nGoogle said in a blog today that it \"welcomed the opportunity to resolve the CMA's concerns collaboratively.\" Apple, meanwhile, seemed similarly pleased with the deal. \"The commitments announced today allow Apple to continue advancing important privacy and security innovations for users and great opportunities for developers,” an Apple spokesperson told Bloomberg.\nThe UK is possibly taking a light touch on app store rules to avoid antagonizing the Trump administration. Earlier today, French President Emmanuel Macron predicted that the US could go after the EU on areas like data privacy, digital taxation and the plan of multiple EU countries to ban children from social media. \"The US will, in the coming months — that’s certain — attack us over digital regulation,\" Macron said at a special summit yesterday. \nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/uk-takes-light-touch-approach-to-regulating-apple-and-googles-app-stores-131119575.html?src=rss",

Written by Jack Wallen, Contributing WriterContributing Writer Feb. 10, 2026 at 4:25 a.m. PT SVS Prime Wireless Pro ZDNET's key takeaways SVS Prime Wireless Pro powered speakers are available for around $899. You won't find a smoother, better-blended sound from an active speaker at this price point. To get the best bass, you should pair these with the SVS SB-1000 Pro subwoofer. View now at SvsoundView now at Best BuyView now at Amazon more buying choices Follow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.Most consumers believe punchy bass and sizzling highs are key to a good speaker. If that sounds like your taste, then you have a lot of options available for you (because a lot of manufacturers cater to booming bass). But the mark of a truly good speaker is the ability to blend the sound in such a way that you hear it as the artist intended. Instead of highlighting the low and high ends, you should aim to get a balance so you can hear all voices, instruments, and ranges coming together to form a perfect union.That's not to say you want a muddy sound (as a lot of low-end speakers will deliver). The goal is to create a sound field that allows each instrument or voice to shine when necessary (such as during a solo or a particularly important passage in a certain vocal range).Also: Update your Echo speakers ASAP for Alexa's most functional upgrade in decades - here's howI've experienced a lot of speakers that punch up certain frequency ranges because, well, that's what's popular. And certain musical genres inadvertently place those demands on manufacturers.But my aural happy place is when a pair of speakers delivers a buttery-smooth blend of sounds that don't force a particular range on me. Instead, I get to hear the music as the artist intended it. For many, such speakers are called \"Studio Monitors\" because they allow listeners to hear the truth in the sound.The SVS Prime Wireless Pro powered speakers delivered that very thing to me. And paired with my SVS SB-1000 Pro subwoofer, everything I threw at the setup was gloriously smooth. Hearing music through these speakers was like coming home. ZDNET Recommends SVS Prime Wireless Pro These speakers deliver some of the smoothest, best-blended sound I've heard at this price point. details View at Best Buy Best bluetooth speaker deals of the week Echo Spot Smart Speaker With Alexa (2024 Release, Black): $50 (save $30) Beats Pill Wireless Portable Bluetooth Speaker (Matte Black): $100 (save $50) Sonos Era 100 Wireless Alexa Enabled Smart Speaker (Black): $169 (save $30) Bang & Olufsen Beosound Explore Portable Bluetooth Speaker (Black): $199 (save $100) Deals are selected by the CNET Group commerce team, and may be unrelated to this article. Classical, choral, rock, prog, metal, classic rock…the genre didn't matter, as these speakers could handle it all.Of course, sound preference is a personal affair, but when you find a pair of speakers that can deliver a neutral sound, without lacking excitement, you know you have something special.Also: The best sound systems you can buy: Expert testedNote: The preset feature is used in combination with the mobile app that you can pair with the speakers. Although I installed the app, I didn't dive too deep into it because I didn't find it necessary.My experienceFirst off, I should mention that I have a unique setup. I listen to both my turntable and PC from the same speakers (I know, bad audiophile). The reason for this setup is that I listen to both while writing. Sometimes, I'll want to hear a piece of music from vinyl, and other times, I'll want to hear something I don't yet have on my medium of choice. And because my office (with cats roaming around) isn't exactly conducive to floor-mount speakers, I tend to go the bookshelf route.My previous speakers included both Aux and Line In inputs, which meant I could plug my Rega P8 turntable into one and my PC into the other.Also: I put away my subwoofer after trying this room-filling soundbar - and it looks greatThe SVS Prime Wireless Pro speakers have a single RCA Line In and a 3.5mm Line In. You can't plug both of those in and expect the speakers to know which device to prioritize. That's when I had to switch my PC to Bluetooth and connect my turntable to the RCA Line In.The only caveat is that my System76 Thelio disconnects the Bluetooth speakers every time the screen locks. So when I log back in, I have to reconnect the speakers via the Bluetooth manager. No big deal.Okay, on to the music. As I said, I ran these speakers through several genres. Here's a representation:Classical - Samuel Barber's Adagio For Strings - By far my favorite piece of classical music, the SVS Prime brought this heartbreaking piece to its fullest life. Every instrument could be picked out of the orchestra, and I was able to close my eyes and just let the smooth sounds wash over me. One very telling moment in this piece is the first movement's climax, where lesser speakers can distort at louder volumes. The SVS Primes handled it without a single crack.Choral - A Choral Christmas - There is no lovelier Christmas album, and this recording came to life with every instrument and voice blending with just enough space and depth to make me feel like I was in the concert hall listening to VOCES8.Classic Rock - Led Zeppelin's Kashmir - This was off the Mothership release, and I've never heard the song with such clarity.Progressive - Rush's Tom Sawyer - This is my go-to for testing speakers, and the SVS Prime gave the song the punch it deserves. Granted, I am using these speakers with the SVS subwoofer, but the kick you get from the very opening of the piece immediately brought a smile to my face. It's charged with power and just as agile as the musicians.Rock/metal - Band-Maid's YOLO - I love this song. From Kanami's near-virtuosity on guitar, Akane's pounding rhythms, Misa's phenomenal bass lines, Miku's rhythm guitar, and Saiki's voice, this song just fills the room with so much sound. And unlike my previous speakers, the song doesn't get lost in a kick-drum-and-throbbing-bass wall. Along with my testing tracks (all played on vinyl), I've spent the past two weeks listening to Christmas music (as I always do this time of year), and every song filled my heart with delight.

Close Home Home & Office Home Entertainment Speakers Finally, I found a Bluetooth speaker that pumps out loud sound (and looks good doing it) The Marshall Woburn 3 is a high-end Bluetooth speaker that both looks and sounds like a professional-grade amp. Written by Prakhar Khanna, Contributing WriterContributing Writer Feb. 10, 2026 at 4:21 a.m. PT Marshall Woburn 3 ZDNET's key takeaways The Woburn 3 is the most expensive home audio speaker from Marshall. It has fantastic sound quality, strong bass, and clear mids. However, the system only supports the SBC codec. $499.99 at Amazon$499.99 at Best Buy$399 at B&H Photo-Video more buying choices Follow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.The Marshall Woburn 3 commands a premium price, and while it's not the best value on specs alone, its rich, powerful sound and iconic design make it a standout for die-hard Marshall fans and audiophiles alike. If you've been considering the brand's flagship Bluetooth speaker, now might be the time to splurge -- discounts are rare, and any price drop makes it a far better deal than paying full retail. ZDNET RECOMMENDS Marshall Woburn 3 One of the latest speakers from the audio company features a stylish design and loud output. details View at Amazon Best bluetooth speaker deals of the week Echo Spot Smart Speaker With Alexa (2024 Release, Black): $50 (save $30) Beats Pill Wireless Portable Bluetooth Speaker (Matte Black): $100 (save $50) Sonos Era 100 Wireless Alexa Enabled Smart Speaker (Black): $169 (save $30) Bang & Olufsen Beosound Explore Portable Bluetooth Speaker (Black): $199 (save $100) Deals are selected by the CNET Group commerce team, and may be unrelated to this article. Timeless look and feel Prakhar Khanna/ZDNETThe Woburn 3 sports the signature Marshall look inspired by the company's old guitar amplifiers. At 7.5kg in weight and 12.5 x 15.8 x 8.0 inches in measurement, it's a big speaker. With its timeless look and feel, the Woburn 3 in Black would blend into any room decor. Also: The best soundbars of 2026: Expert tested and recommendedOn top, you get a faux leather finish with brass control knobs for Volume, Base, and Treble. They're accompanied by a power switch, a playback control slider knob, an aux port, and another button to switch between Bluetooth, aux, RCA, and HDMI inputs. The front is a cloth speaker grille with the company's branding, completing the classy, elegant look. Connectivity options include Bluetooth v5.2, HDMI, RCA, and a 3.5 mm jack. You also get a cavity on the back to make it easier to pick up and move the speaker when needed. Where it lacks in features, it makes up for in soundThe Marshall Woburn 3 isn't as feature-rich as some other speakers in this price range. There's no Wi-Fi or voice assistant support, and you miss out on AAC, AptX, LDAC, and other hi-res capable codecs. Marshall has put a lot of effort into the hardware but has done a poor job by limiting wireless source support. If you can look past it, the speaker does a fantastic job at what it's made for. Also: I put away my subwoofer after trying this room-filling soundbar - and it looks greatThe Woburn 3 features a 90 W Class D amplifier powering a 6-inch woofer, with dual 15 W amplifiers. Two 15W Class D amplifiers drive the two 0.75-inch tweeters. These are all highly capable drivers. Prakhar Khanna/ZDNETI had the treble and bass knobs set to neutral throughout my testing. The speaker delivers strong bass with the woofer's low-end power. It has a bass-forward DSP that delivers detail even at low volumes. You can feel the sub-bass thumps at 30% or higher volume. Go louder, and the bass stays clean and detailed.Also: Your LG TV is getting a big audio performance upgrade for free - including these OLED modelsYou'll enjoy listening to rock, punk, and heavy metal just as much as you do acoustic music. The drums feel headbanging-worthy, and the acoustic strums also sound bright and detailed. The vocals are clear, and the mids are detailed with sparkly highs. However, the higher frequencies tend to distort slightly at high volume. The sound signature is very enjoyable, and the speaker can fill a big room at 70% volume. If the physical controls are out of reach, the Woburn 3 can be paired with the Marshall Bluetooth app to adjust in-app EQ. You can also use the Placement Compensation feature to set the speaker at the best place in your room, and it'll adjust the sound accordingly. To get the most out of your speaker, you just need to answer two basic questions. ZDNET's buying adviceThe Marshall Woburn 3 isn't the best value for money -- it costs more than it offers. The drivers support hi-res codecs, but if you want a speaker for its performance and timeless aesthetic, the Marshall Woburn 3 is a great deal at $515.The big Marshall home speaker delivers strong, clean bass with a rumble, alongside bright highs and detailed mids. It's superb for big rooms. But if you want something smaller from Marshall, the Stanmore 3 is great too. You can get it for around $399, where the missing codec support is still formidable.Featured reviews I spent weeks with Alexa on the Echo Show 11, and it was awesome (until I started fact-checking) Sony LinkBuds Clip vs. Bose QuietComfort Open: This model wins big I replaced my bedroom TV with a $180 Roku projector - and don't regret it I found the Lenovo ThinkPad to rule them all - and its modular RAM changes everything I spent weeks with Alexa on the Echo Show 11, and it was awesome (until I started fact-checking) Sony LinkBuds Clip vs. Bose QuietComfort Open: This model wins big I replaced my bedroom TV with a $180 Roku projector - and don't regret it I found the Lenovo ThinkPad to rule them all - and its modular RAM changes everything Editorial standards Show Comments Log In to Comment Community Guidelines Related This Bluetooth speaker I tested delivers immersive sound at a price that's easy on the wallet I've yet to find a Bluetooth speaker that delivers more powerful bass and clearer mids than this How I upgraded my soundbar audio quality for free - and 4 other methods to give it a boost"

Written by Jack Wallen, Contributing WriterContributing Writer Feb. 10, 2026 at 4:15 a.m. PT Jack Wallen / Elyse Betters Picaro / ZDNETFollow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.I've been using Android since version 1.5, so it's rare for a feature to catch me off guard. You can imagine that when I do come across an unfamiliar Android feature, it's an exciting moment.For more casual (or newer) users of Google's mobile operating system, there are probably several hidden gems waiting to be discovered in Android, and some of these can be handy.Also: How to clear your Android phone cache (and say goodbye to slow performance)I've curated five somewhat hidden Android features that I believe every user should at least know about. Let's dive into those features.1. Share Wi-Fi via QR codeYou may not give this feature a second thought, but allow me to set a scene for you. Say you're having visitors for the holidays and want to grant them access to your Wi-Fi network. Instead of making the password public (so anyone can use it), you could share the Wi-Fi credentials via QR code. Not only does this approach simplify adding another device to the network, but it also does so with a nod to security. Open Settings > 'Network and Internet' > Internet, and tap the network you want to share. At the top of the resulting page, tap Share and verify it's you via biometrics or password/PIN.Also: My secret trick to easily share Wi-Fi passwords with guests (and why I can't go back)A new page will open with a QR code for the selected Wi-Fi network. Present the QR code to whoever you want to scan it with their phone, a process that automatically adds the network to their device. You could also screenshot the QR code, print it out, and make the printout available (so you don't have to hand your phone around for people to scan). Sharing Wi-Fi via QR Code makes the process so much easier. Screenshot by Jack Wallen/ZDNET2. Enable 'Developer options'Android's 'Developer options' menu isn't just for developers. Anyone can enable it and gain access to a host of features, some of which are very handy. With Developer options enabled, you can configure the maximum number of Bluetooth devices allowed to connect to your phone, unlock your bootloader, enable automatic system updates, enable USB debugging, edit the graphics driver settings, force peak refresh rate, and much more. Developer options should be enabled if you want power user-level control over Android. Also: How to factory reset your Android phone without unlocking it firstTo enable the feature, go to Settings > About Phone, scroll to the bottom of the page, and tap 'Build number' seven times. Once you've done that, you'll find 'Developer options' in Settings > System. Tap that entry to reveal the new options. You'll find tons of new configuration options here. Screenshot by Jack Wallen/ZDNET3. Text translationIf you're traveling outside your country, you might need help translating text. Fortunately, Android is quite capable of translating text via the camera app.This is an impressive feature. Let's say you have a menu or some other information you want translated. Unlock your Android phone and tap the Lens icon in the Search bar. Point your camera at what you want to translate and tap the Translate button.Also: 5 habit trackers on Android that can reveal your patterns - and motivate you to changeAndroid will automatically translate the text and display it as an image (almost exactly how it's laid out in the original document). You can then view the translated text, copy it to your computer, take a screenshot, or search for it. You could use this feature for just about any situation where you need text translated automatically.As a bonus, there's also the official Google Translate app, which can listen to voices and translate from one language to another. If you travel to countries where you don't speak the native language, this app should be a must-have. Translating the text from the Howl's Moving Castle soundtrack. On the left is the original, and on the right is the translated text. Screenshot by Jack Wallen/ZDNET4. Use Extend UnlockWhen at home, I don't need to lock my phone because I'm not concerned that someone will grab it and steal my information. Where physical threats to your phone are minimal, consider making access easier by enabling Extend Unlock (which used to be called Smart Lock) and adding your home as a Trusted Place. Also: How to start using the new Linux terminal on your Android deviceTo do this, go to Settings > 'Security & privacy' > 'More security & privacy' > Extend Unlock. You'll be prompted to verify that it's you and then be presented with a description of Extend Unlock. On the next page, you can configure Extend Unlock for on-body detection, trusted places, or trusted devices. Tap 'Trusted places' and, on the resulting page, add a new trusted place. Once you've done that step, whenever you arrive at your trusted place, your phone will be unlocked automatically until you leave that location.Note that this approach can lead to security issues, especially if you have guests in your home. With that in mind, use this feature judiciously. Use Extend Unlock with caution. Screenshot by Jack Wallen/ZDNET5. Set your medical informationAndroid allows you to store important medical information, such as name, height, weight, gender, blood type, date of birth, organ donor status, pregnancy status, medications, address, and medical notes. If you ever need this feature, you'll be glad you took advantage of it. To add your medical information, go to Settings > 'Safety & emergency' > 'Medical information'. On the next page, add whatever information you deem important. There are two caveats to this feature. First, emergency responders need to know about the feature to use it. Second, those same responders would have to be able to unlock your phone to access it. Also: The best SSH clients for Android - including my two favoritesTo get around that issue, tap 'Change setting' at the bottom and, on the resulting page, make the information available, even when your phone is locked, during an emergency call. To access this feature, tap Emergency at the bottom of the dial pad (for the unlock screen) and then tap View Emergency Information. Even with these hurdles, it's an important feature to have available should you need it. Add only the information you deem necessary for medical emergencies. Screenshot by Jack Wallen/ZDNET6. Gboard clipboardYou might not know this fact, but the Android keyboard (Gboard) has some impressive clipboard features. Once enabled, you can copy text and images (holding them on the clipboard for up to an hour before forgetting them), save and edit clips (so you can reuse them later), pin clips (by touching and holding them), and more. Also: I changed 12 settings on my Android phone to dramatically improve battery lifeYou have to enable the Gboard clipboard manually. Otherwise, Android will use the traditional, built-in clipboard. I much prefer the Gboard clipboard because of the extended features. You enable the clipboard by opening the keyboard (from within any app), tapping the clipboard icon, and then tapping the On/Off slider until it's in the On position. The Gboard clipboard is so much better than the default. Screenshot by Jack Wallen/ZDNETFeatured Want local vibe coding?

John Timmer – Feb 10, 2026 7:15 am | 14 Credit: the_burtons Credit: the_burtons Text settings Story text Size Small Standard Large Width * Standard Wide Links Standard Orange * Subscribers only Learn more Minimize to nav On Friday, a body that advises US judges revised the document it created to help judges grapple with scientific issues. The move came after a group of Republican state attorneys general wrote a letter to complain about the document’s chapter on climate change, with one of the letter’s criticisms being that it treated human influence on climate as a fact. In response to the letter, the Federal Judicial Center has now deleted the entire chapter. The Federal Judicial Center has been established by statute as the “research and education agency of the judicial branch of the United States Government.” As part of that role, it prepares documents that can serve as reference material for judges unfamiliar with topics that find their way into the courtroom. Among those projects is the “Reference Manual on Scientific Evidence,” now in its fourth edition. Prepared in collaboration with the National Academies of Science, the document covers the process of science and specific topics that regularly appear before the courts, like statistical techniques, DNA-based identification, and chemical exposures. When initially released in December, the fourth edition included material on climate change prepared by two authors at Columbia University. But a group of attorneys general from Republican-leaning states objected to this content. At the end of January, they sent a letter to the leadership of the Federal Judicial Center outlining their issues. Many of them focus on the text that accepts the reality of human-driven climate change as a fact. “Nothing is ‘independent’ or ‘impartial’ in issuing a document on behalf of America’s judges declaring that only one preferred view is ‘within the boundaries of scientifically sound knowledge,’” the letter complains, while ignoring many topics where the document does exactly that. But the objections are only about one specific area of science: “The Fourth Edition places the judiciary firmly on one side of some of the most hotly disputed questions in current litigation: climate-related science and ‘attribution.’” In short, the state attorneys general object to the document treating facts as facts, as there have been lawsuits that contested them. “Among other things, the Manual states that human activities have ‘unequivocally warmed the climate,’ that it is ‘extremely likely’ human influence drives ocean warming, and that researchers are ‘virtually certain’ about ocean acidification,” their letter states, “treating contested litigation positions as settled fact.” In other words, they’re arguing that, if someone is ignorant enough to start a suit based on ignorance of well-established science, then the Federal Judicial Center should join them in their ignorance. The attorneys general also complain that the report calls the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change an “authoritative science body,” citing a conservative Canadian public policy think tank that disagreed with that assessment. These complaints were mixed in with some more potentially reasonable complaints about how the climate chapter gave specific suggestions on how to legally approach some issues, and assigned significance to one or two recent studies that haven’t yet been validated by follow-on work. But the letter’s authors would not settle for revisions based on a few reasonable complaints; instead, they demand the entire chapter be removed because it accurately reflects the status of climate science. Naturally, the Federal Judicial Center has agreed. We have confirmed that the current version of the document no longer includes a chapter on climate science, even though the foreword by Supreme Court Justice Elana Kagan still mentions it.

They've made life so much better -- reducing frustration and eliminating those morning panics over finding my keys and wallet.While the Apple AirTag is undoubtedly the best of the best -- it's the only tag to offer precision finding -- plenty of third-party finder tags offer features that AirTags can't provide.Also: AirTag 2 vs. AirTag 1: I compared both Bluetooth trackers, and the winner is not so obviousOne company hitting it out of the park with finder tags is Rolling Square, whose two latest options are fantastic.

When the battery goes flat, just pop the AirCard Pro on a wireless charger, and it'll be charged up in 90 minutes.Also: How to find out if an AirTag is tracking you - and what to do about itThe laser-etched QR code lets you create a Digital ID to which you can add your contact info, social media links, and any other personal data you want. You can share this ID by getting people to scan the QR code. If the worst happens and you lose your wallet, you can change the message to include information to help you get it back. The omnidirectional speaker is much louder than the speaker on the AirTag. Adrian Kingsley-Hughes/ZDNET Next is the AirNotch Pro, a finder tag for fitting onto keys. Again, this is another world's first for Rolling Square: a Bluetooth finder tag that is Android- and Apple-compatible (again, the black tags are for Apple's Find My network, and the white ones for Google's Find My Device network), with a replaceable battery and 360-degree omnidirectional sound.Also: I created the ultimate Wi-Fi password key with the most unexpected gadget - how it worksThese tags are also built to survive, made of tough ABS plastic, robust CNC-machined anodized aluminum, and custom gaskets -- providing IP68-rated dust- and water-resistance. Everything is held together with a dozen Torx screws.Embedded into the case are ultra-bright photoluminescent glow-in-the-dark inserts that help you find your items day or night -- a fantastic touch. Yes, it has glow-in-the-dark elements for easy finding in low-light conditions. Adrian Kingsley-Hughes/ZDNET The tags measure 54.8 x 27.6 x 10.2 mm/2.2 x 1.1 x 0.4 inches and weigh only 23 grams/0.35 ounces. Inside are two CR2032 replaceable button batteries, which will last 20 months before needing to be replaced. The AirNotch Pro also features two super-loud buzzers that emit omnidirectional 360-degree sound to help you locate your items. ZDNET's buying adviceI do like Rolling Square hardware. Everything the company makes that I've tested has exceeded my expectations (it also makes some excellent charging cables).Also: This smart luggage lock has effectively replaced the AirTag for me when travelingRolling Square products combine great engineering with tough construction; these tags are no exception. I love the handy little features, such as the super-loud buzzer -- Apple really needs a louder buzzer on the AirTags -- and the use of photoluminescent paint.The AirCard Pro and AirNotch Pro are both pricier than the AirTag, but they work on both Apple and Android networks, have more features, and are built to last.

Close Home Tech Services & Software Operating Systems Mobile OS Android Need a rugged Android tablet for your business? I tested one that looks great and lasts all day The Oukitel RT10 tablet is built like a tank yet still delivers a bright, vivid display at a fair price. Written by Jack Wallen, Contributing WriterContributing Writer Feb. 10, 2026 at 4:09 a.m. PT Oukitel RT10 tablet ZDNET's key takeaways The Oukitel RT10 tablet is on sale now for $429. This beefy tablet has respectable performance and unrivaled battery life. If you're looking for something light and delicate, look elsewhere. View now at Oukitel Follow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.For me, Oukitel is synonymous with ruggedness. Every product I've ever been sent from them is an exercise in durability. Just picking up one the brand's tablets or phones makes you realize how light and delicate other brands' devices actually are. The RT10 tablet is no exception. It's thick, heavy, and sturdy, but it's no gimmick. Also: I tested a 33,000mAh Android phone with a built-in projector for a week - here's my verdictYou might think these brawny devices would be a gimmick, but they actually serve an important purpose. Consider this: You take your delicate iPad out into the field (or camping, or anywhere that doesn't offer ideal conditions) and wind up having to carry it around as carefully as you might a newborn baby. ZDNET RECOMMENDS Oukitel RT10 Tablet This heavy-duty tablet can take a beating and continue running for days. details View at Oukitel The RT10 weighs in at a chonky 1255g. To put that into perspective, the 13-inch M4 iPad Pro weighs a scant 523g. Given the RT10 is an 11-inch tablet, the 11-inch version of the same iPad only weighs 444g. The RT10 weighs nearly three times the iPad. Of course, the iPad would shudder if you took it into the conditions the RT10 is built for. My experienceWith the form factor out of the way, let's talk about how I fared with the Oukitel RT10. After unboxing the tablet, I connected Android to my Google account and set up the usual features (fingerprint, etc). As with any Android device, it was incredibly easy.I then went about my usual testing. The first thing I do with tablets and phones is see how responsive the UI is. In the case of the RT10, the Android UI was a bit sluggish. Also: Why I'm recommending Google's Pixel Buds in 2026 (after years of passing on them)That aroused my curiosity. I decided to install a different homescreen launcher. To be specific, I went with O Launcher. Why did I do this? Primarily because O Launcher uses fewer system resources than most, I figured it might solve the tablet's sluggishness.Lo and behold, using O Launcher as my default solved that issue. Now the RT10 runs like an absolute champ.With speed no longer an issue, I put the tablet through the usual paces. Here are my conclusions:Display: It's quite crisp. I'd go so far as to say that this is the best tablet display Oukitel has produced.Sound: The speakers are capable of producing very loud sound. On top of that, it offers a pretty good amount of bass, preventing the sound from being too tinny (like so many tablets). This might be the best-sounding tablet I've tested.Performance: Once I installed O Launcher, the RT10 performed very well. Out of the box, however, it was a little sluggish.Battery: Good grief, the battery just keeps going and going. I set up the tablet and put it away for over a month. When I started it up again, there was still a 94% charge.OS: It's Android 15, but I've got no big gripes there.RAM: Out of the box, you get 16GB. Like all Oukitel devices, you can bump that up with what they call Memory Expansion. In all my time testing Oukitel devices, I've yet to see memory expansion have much impact on performance. This time, however, I noticed a slight bump after enabling the feature.Cameras: I was actually surprised by the quality of the pictures the cameras produced. Even the selfie camera wasn't too shabby. No, they aren't as good as the Pixel cameras, but they can hold their own. The Camera app also doesn't include a horde of AI features, so it's just point-and-click goodness. The Macro camera is pretty good, but don't think you're going to win any awards with it. Me and my goofy mug. Jack Wallen/ZDNETThe big issue some users might have is the weight. The RT10 is as heavy as a tablet can be. What you have to remember, however, is that's part of what makes Oukitel's products so unique. The RT10 is specifically made to thrive in tough conditions. Take this tablet to the beach, on a hike, to a construction site… it doesn't matter because it's got the oomph to stand up to just about anything you can throw at it.Also: The best rugged phones in 2026: Tested by expertsAnother thing I really appreciate about the Oukitel tablets is that most of them ship with a handy (and very sturdy) kickstand. The kickstand has to be attached, and it adds to the weight, but it's very much worth using. Gotta love these beefy kickstands. Jack Wallen/ZDNETYou also get a hand strap you can attach. Both of these accessories are attached by way of screws, so they are rock solid. Lastly, there's a carrying strap you can attach to the kickstand to make carrying the RT10 around easier.ZDNET's buying adviceThe Oukitel line of devices appeals to a certain cross-section of society. If you drive a Ford F150 to work and you come home caked in dirt or construction dust, this tablet is for you. If you're a hiker or camper, ditto. As well, if you want a tablet with an absolutely massive battery, you could do a whole lot worse than the RT10.If, on the other hand, you prefer a tablet that weighs nothing, looks like every other tablet being carried around, and you don't like Android, this tablet is most certainly not for you.Oukitel RT10 tablet specsDisplay: 11-inch IPS FHD+ 1200 x 1920 with a 120Hz refresh rate and 500 nits brightness.Processor: MediaTek Dimensity 7400X (4x 2.6 GHz Cortex-A78 + 4x 2.0 GHz Cortex-A55).Memory & Storage: 12GB LPDDR5 RAM (expandable up to 36GB) and 512GB UFS 3.0 internal storage, with support for up to 2TB expandable storage.Battery: 25,000mAh capacity with 33W fast charging and reverse charging capability.Cameras: 64MP main rear camera (OV64B40), 20MP Sony night vision camera, 5MP macro lens, and 32MP Samsung front camera.Ruggedization: IP68/IP69K water/dust resistance and MIL-STD-810H certification, surviving drops up to 1.5 meters.Connectivity: 5G, Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.4, NFC, and GPS.Audio & Ports: Dual 5W speakers (>130dB), USB-C, and pogo pin connector.OS: Android 15.Industry Version Features: Includes a 2D barcode scanner and a customizable fingerprint module for enterprise useFeatured reviews I spent weeks with Alexa on the Echo Show 11, and it was awesome (until I started fact-checking) Sony LinkBuds Clip vs. Bose QuietComfort Open: This model wins big I replaced my bedroom TV with a $180 Roku projector - and don't regret it I found the Lenovo ThinkPad to rule them all - and its modular RAM changes everything I spent weeks with Alexa on the Echo Show 11, and it was awesome (until I started fact-checking) Sony LinkBuds Clip vs. Bose QuietComfort Open: This model wins big I replaced my bedroom TV with a $180 Roku projector - and don't regret it I found the Lenovo ThinkPad to rule them all - and its modular RAM changes everything Editorial standards Show Comments Log In to Comment Community Guidelines Related We ran battery tests on 9 popular tablets - this model lasted the longest (and other surprise results) I lived with this 25-inch Android tablet for a week - and it went surprisingly well The tablet that replaced my iPad and Kindle got a worthy successor (and it's just as cheap)"

The company the city and making sure they can operate as fully autonomous rides before launching a paid service in the location. Waymo announced that it was planning to bring its robotaxis to Nashville in September 2025, with the intention opening up rides to the public sometime this year. The company has been testing its technology in Nashville since then, but it has yet say when it’ll start accepting bookings for rides.\nThe company conducts extensive testing in every new city before deploying its robotaxi service. It starts by having safety drivers map the area and then updating its software with information learned from those tests, since each city has its own driving rules and conditions. Despite its testing, Waymo has had to issue a software recall several times in the past  after its vehicles malfunctioned when faced with real hazards on the road. Its vehicles were previously seeing hitting gates, chains, telephone poles and stationary vehicles. Most recently, it issued a recall because its robotaxis failed to stop for school buses.\nAt the moment, Waymo vehicles are already open to the public in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Miami and Phoenix, as well as in Atlanta and Austin through a partnership with Uber. It’s active in a lot more locations, including New York, New Orleans, Seattle and even Tokyo, Japan, but it’s not serving riders in those locations yet. Nashville is in the list of new locations where Waymo is conducting or planning to conduct driverless trials, along with Boston, Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Houston, Las Vegas, Orlando, Sacramento, San Antonio, San Diego, Washington and London, UK. \nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/waymos-vehicles-are-now-fully-driverless-in-nashville-120412343.html?src=rss",

ZDNET's key takeaways If Windows is your preferred operating system, consider these open-source apps.There are numerous open-source apps available for almost any task.These are all free to install and use on Windows.I've been using open-source software for a very long time. In fact, the last time I didn't use open-source software, Bill Clinton was president of the US.Also: This 11-in-1 docking station is the office productivity gadget I didn't know I neededOpen-source software is available for nearly every operating system on the market, from desktops to phones, and I often find open-source apps are superior to their proprietary counterparts. If you're a Windows user, you don't have to remain locked into closed-source software, because there are so many alternatives from which you can choose. Let me introduce you to some of my favorites. 1. LibreOffice LibreOffice has been my go-to office suite since way back when it was a twinkle in the eye of StarOffice, and I haven't looked back since. LibreOffice includes all the tools you're used to in an office suite and even includes a database component (similar to MS Access). And with a customizable user interface, you can work with a modern UI or one that recalls the days of yore. Also: 6 ways LibreOffice is better than Google Docs for serious writing workLibreOffice is installed locally, so you don't have to worry about a third-party cloud service accessing your information. You can set LibreOffice to automatically save in the MS Office default formats, so collaborating with those using Microsoft's tool is a no-brainer. LibreOffice is free to download and install for Windows. 2. Flow Launcher Flow Launcher is a quick file search and app launcher for Windows. With Flow Launcher, you use a customizable hot key to launch the tool and then search for whatever it is you're looking for. You can open apps, search for files, and browse the internet with your default search engine. Flow Launcher includes themes, animations, and sounds, and even allows you to build your own customizations. There are also community-created plugins to extend the feature set. Also: Can't upgrade your Windows 10 PC? You have 5 days left - and 5 optionsFlow Launcher is free to download and install. 3. Duplicati Duplicati is a zero-trust backup solution that can back up from Windows (or any OS) to any destination you need. You can back up to Dropbox, Box, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, or Amazon Web Services, or to other machines on your LAN for greater privacy. Duplicati allows for scheduling and remote management, and it has a straightforward installation. Your backups are fully encrypted, and you can easily monitor them for real-time insights via a well-designed dashboard. Duplicati is free for personal use. 4. Nextcloud If you're tired of using Google or Microsoft's cloud-based offerings (especially out of fear that they are using your data to train LLMs), there's always Nextcloud, the open-source, locally run alternative to cloud services. Nextcloud includes everything you need for file storage, sharing, collaboration, communication, organization, and more. There's also an app store where you can install plugins to extend the feature set. Also: Your Windows PC has a secretly useful backup tool - here's how to access itYou can install and use Nextcloud on Windows for free and even install the Nextcloud Desktop client for even easier usage. 5. Franz If you use several messaging apps and services, you might want to consider Franz, which brings them all into a single, user-friendly GUI. Franz lets you add WhatsApp, Facebook, Messenger, Slack, Telegram, Google Calendar, Discord, LinkedIn, Trello, Office 365 Outlook, Google Keep, and more, so you don't have to switch back and forth between apps. You can add as many accounts as you want and easily switch between them without leaving the Franz UI. Also: 5 tools I trust to keep my online conversations private and anonymousFranz is free to install and use. 6. YAZB YAZB (aka YAZB Reborn) lets you create custom Windows top bars (similar to macOS) that display helpful system information, such as battery status, internet speeds, weather, and more -- all with a clean, minimal, elegant style. YAZB also gives you quick access to shutdown/restart controls, customizable themes/icons/layouts, and allows you to add as many helpful widgets as you need. 7. File Converter If you've ever needed to easily convert or compress a file in Windows, File Converter has your back. Using a right-click context menu entry (within the file manager), you can convert audio, video, images, and documents from one format to another. In the case of documents, you can convert nearly any format into a PDF. You can also compress files in the same way. Also: How to upgrade your 'incompatible' Windows 10 PC to Windows 11 - for freeThe only caveat is that to convert MS Office files, you'll need MS Office installed. You can customize the application order within the context menu and even add or remove presets. File Converter is free to install and use on Windows. 8. Bitwarden If you don't use a password manager, you should start immediately. If you need a password manager, you should place Bitwarden at the top of your list. Not only is Bitwarden open-source, but it's also one of the best password managers on the market. With every feature you'll need (including a web browser extension), Bitwarden can do more to help keep you protected by simplifying the process of using strong, unique passwords. This open-source password manager includes a password generator (that can do both passwords and pass phrases), Bitwarden Send (to send files and text safely), and more. Bitwarden can be installed and used for free on Windows. You might even consider purchasing a license, as it gives you more collaboration features, which can come in handy with a large family or organization. 9. AutoHotKey AutoHotKey is an automation scripting language for Windows that allows you to define hotkeys for both mouse and keyboard, remap keys or buttons, and more. With AutoHotKey, you can automate just about any desktop task. Also: I always install these 5 free apps on every Windows PC - here's why they're essentialEssentially, this app makes it easy to work with hotkeys and macros while helping you work more efficiently. There is a learning curve with AutoHotkey, but once you've learned it, you'll be glad you took the time. AutoHotKey can be installed and used for free on Windows. 10. Ollama If you want to use AI but don't like the idea of a third party using your queries or data to train their LLMs, consider the open-source Ollama, which is easy to use and even includes a well-designed GUI for interacting and adding models. With Ollama, you can work with a large selection of models, ranging from the tiny to the very large. One thing to keep in mind, however, is that the larger the model, the more system resources it will require. You would also be best served by using Ollama on a Windows machine with a dedicated GPU. Ollama can be installed and used for free on Windows.Featured Want local vibe coding?

Super comfortable titanium and magnesium frame. Smart AI integration. Better battery. Wide prescription lens support. Optional R1 smart ring makes control simpler.TIREDSoftware stability remains an issue. Smart ring is an extra $249. Navigation needs a little finessing. The display is tricky to read in bright light.In the 19 months since Even Realities launched the G1, its first pair of smart glasses, the four-eyed tech landscape has evolved at a pace. Ray-Ban has sold more than 2 million Meta Glasses, Oakley has joined the fun, and CES 2026 was awash with options from companies including Lucyd, RayNeo, Xreal, and MemoMind.The Even G1 originally stood out partly because the glasses featured a brilliant heads-up display, but mostly because they only looked “smart” in the sartorial sense. They weren’t perfect, with glitchy controls and more software updates than Windows 98, but the potential was huge.Launched in November 2025, the new Even G2 smart glasses weigh just 1.26 ounces, boast a 75 percent larger display, and can also be controlled by the Even R1, the company's first-ever smart ring. I’ve been wearing one for a few months and have been astounded by the technology on show and impressed by the updates, but some of the first-gen woes remain.What’s New?Photograph: Julian ChokkattuThe Even G2 glasses don't look especially different from the original G1, which is a good thing, because they are still arguably the sharpest-looking smart glasses available. There’s still a choice of G2 A—a classic oval shape—and G2 B, with a rectangular frame, in gray, brown, and a new muted green colorway.Even Realities G2 Smart GlassesRating: 6/10$599 at Even RealitiesThey are around 0.28 ounces lighter than the original, thanks to the new combination of aerospace-grade magnesium alloy and titanium temples. It’s not a huge difference, but the profile is a touch slimmer too. As a result, they feel even more like a normal pair of glasses.Like its predecessor, there are no cameras or audio playback, with the company preferring to keep its tech discreet. Notifications, navigation cues, translations, and AI-assisted prompts appear briefly in your field of view, then disappear. Paired with the new R1 smart control ring, the system is designed to keep interaction subtle.Photograph: Julian ChokkattuThe display system has been upgraded, with Even HAO 2.0 (Holistic Adaptive Optics), which pairs micro-LED projectors and gradient waveguide optics with precision-engineered lenses to produce a display that’s roughly 75 percent larger and significantly sharper than the original. Look carefully at the lenses and you’ll see a faint rectangle in each eye. This is where the projector displays crisp green digital text. Brightness can be adjusted to a searing 1,200 nits, making the display easier to read in variable light. There's also a second menu screen that floats in front of the main notifications page.The G2 gains IP67 water and dust resistance, and prescription support has improved to cover −12.00 to +12.00 diopters. Given how thin the lenses are, this is an impressive feat of engineering. Battery life is also improved, up from 1.5 to two full days.Controls are better now, too, and the touch panel on the temple tips is more responsive, with a quick touch or slide. But the headline upgrade is the $249 R1 smart ring. This zirconia ceramic and medical-grade stainless steel ring serves as both a thumb controller for the G2 interface and a wellness tracker, letting users scroll, tap, and interact without touching the glasses while also capturing metrics like heart rate, steps, and sleep. It has the potential to be a powerful tool, mixing a bright but discreet heads-up display with equally clandestine control from the ring.Smart EyesAimed squarely at the business professional, the Even G2 is designed to make work life easier. The Teleprompt feature is superb if you want to add polish to your public speaking, and it’s made all the better thanks to the bigger display. Add text via the app, and the microphone follows along as you talk, bolding the words in real time. You pause, and it pauses.Even AI is the onboard virtual assistant—pulling information from a mix of Gemini, ChatGPT Perplexity, and Even LLM—that can help answer questions without reaching for your phone. Just say “Hey, Even!” and ask. As with the first generation, when this works well, it’s brilliant, and concise answers swiftly appear for me to read, and using the R1 ring, scrolling longer answers is intuitive too. Sadly, while the results are accurate, it can often take far too long to process and display them. It needs to be a fluid interaction, and it’s just not quite there yet.Even Realities G2 Smart GlassesRating: 6/10$599 at Even RealitiesThe Navigate widget has been updated, and both the map view and speed of directions are much clearer than before. As a cyclist, I have used this feature more than any other and found it reliable, although the always-on map display is irritating, and pop-up alerts would make for a better experience.Translation has also improved, with support for 33-plus languages, and translations appear faster and more fluent than before. It’s still hamstrung by being predominantly a one-way transaction, but you can now hand over your phone to the person you’re talking to, so both of you can see their speech translated and displayed. When Even Realities finally adds audio to future smart glasses—and it will—this will be a brilliant feature.Photograph: Chris HaslamThe biggest innovation comes in the form of Conversate, the company's AI-driven conversation assistant. Once activated, it listens to your conversation and processes speech in real time. It identifies key topics, terms, and questions as you talk, then displays contextual cues—such as explanations of concepts, definitions of technical words, basic biographies of people mentioned—on the heads-up display. It also generates a live transcript and a summary you can review later in the app. In practice, it works impressively well, and mentioning famous people, sports teams, and events in history did indeed bring up prompts and facts in real time. The transcription aspect is excellent too, with accurate summaries and suggestions.I had hoped it would turn me into a sports stats guru down the pub, secretly being able to recall long-since-retired soccer players and obscure nuggets of information. It’s not quite there yet, and at times it would lag behind the chat and become a hindrance rather than a help, but it did suggest a cure for a friend’s particularly painful hangover.Having information flash up on screen is handy, but I found reading and digesting this information, while maintaining a conversation, to be pretty difficult. I’d occasionally be caught staring off into the middle distance mid-chat. The display is easy to read in most instances, but changeable light, especially sunshine, and chaotic backgrounds don’t help. Walking also bounces the display—like an erratic autocue—so think twice before trying to impress on a walk-and-talk with the boss.Even Realities G2 Smart GlassesRating: 6/10$599 at Even RealitiesAnd then there are the ethical implications of Conversate. Unlike Meta’s smart glasses, there’s no visible indicator that a conversation is being recorded. Even Realities told me the audio isn’t saved, only the transcribed text, but it still feels like something you should ask permission for before switching it on. I can see the appeal of having AI quietly prompting you during a meeting or even a job interview if you’re brave, but that usefulness arguably depends on it being covert, which puts you on thin ice. At the same time, openly flagging that you’re using AI would rather defeat the point.App AffairScreenshotEven Realities via Chris HaslamThe payoff for having such “normal-looking\" glasses is that the Even G2 is wholly reliant on its app and a stable Bluetooth connection. Available for iOS and Android, the app, much like the heads-up display, is a stripped-back monochrome affair, with easily accessible modes.Navigation and setup are intuitive, and it’s easy to adjust settings, choose how the HUD appears in front of your eyes, enable notifications, and decide what you want on the main dashboard. You can choose from news outlets (including WIRED), plus calendar and stock information. It’s sparse, but if you need instant access to the Nikkei Index, you’re sorted.I like how minimal and easy to navigate the app is, but not the number of times I’ve had to reboot, upgrade, connect, and disconnect the glasses during testing. The pair I received was still in beta, so bugs are to be expected, but even after the official launch and rollout of the consumer-ready app, it remains a lottery as to whether the G2 glasses and R1 ring will work as smoothly as they should.Software stability was the biggest issue I had with the original G1 glasses, and I’m annoyed it hasn’t been resolved here. I’m fine with firmware updates, especially with emerging tech like this, but not being able to rely on the glasses when I need them is hugely frustrating.Bling RingSporting a touch-sensitive surface along one side, the Even R1 ring (a $249 optional addition) lets you tap, swipe, and hold with your thumb to navigate the glasses' interface. It’s a genuinely useful accessory that makes day-to-day use of the G2 far easier than tapping the temple tips. Aesthetically, it looks good, though the Even logo wouldn’t have been my first choice. It does at least serve a purpose, indicating the correct orientation so the touchpad is within reach.The ring makes a big difference to usability and interactivity. You can scroll subtly without touching the frames, making it easier to forget you’re wearing smart glasses at all. There is a learning curve, and if you absent-mindedly fidget with your fingers, as I do, you’ll open menus by accident. It does get easier and smoother with practice.The R1 also tracks your sleep, steps, and heart rate, which is a neat touch. It’s not as accurate as my Garmin smartwatch or Whoop band, and the information is presented in a more rudimentary way, but there’s potential if you haven’t already invested in a wearable.Even Realities G2 Smart GlassesRating: 6/10$599 at Even RealitiesBattery life is a respectable four days for the ring, and the charging stand is nice. It is an expensive add-on, pushing the total (before prescription lenses) to $848, but having used the glasses both with and without the R1 Ring, I think it is money well spent.Last LookPhotograph: Chris HaslamAs a glasses-wearing tech journalist, I really love the idea of the Even Realities G2. Having AI help with tricky conversations, translate languages, answer questions, keep me up to date with my messages and emails, diary dates, and news headlines, without relying on my phone, is a brilliant idea.The design and engineering that have gone into these smart glasses is seriously clever. Getting the lenses that thin, while increasing display size, improving the fit, and reducing the weight points to a time when this technology will be seamlessly integrated into our regular rims. The G2 feels like the future, and they can be genuinely useful day-to-day. The fact that they also feel like standard glasses just adds to the appeal. The company also plans to open the software to app developers for third-party apps, a smart move indeed.At $599, they’re a premium choice. It’s more than I would personally spend on a pair of glasses, no matter how “smart” they are, but if you’ve already bought the Rimowa luggage, the Mont Blanc fountain pen, and the Tom Ford suit, this won’t be an issue.So the screen has improved, the glasses are better in most ways from the first generation, and the use of AI has evolved nicely with Conversate. But the day-to-day enjoyment and experience of the Even R2 glasses and Even R1 ring is hampered by slow connections, signal dropouts, software glitches, and all too frequent updates. When it works, it works brilliantly, but a product like this, one aimed at the busiest of professionals, needs to be absolutely friction-free. The hardware is ready, the software just needs to catch up, and quickly, especially with the Meta Ray-Ban Display hot on their heels.Even Realities G2 Smart GlassesRating: 6/10$599 at Even Realities$599 at Even Realities"

Close Home Tech Smartphones 3 upgrades the Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra needs for me to take it seriously (as an S25 owner) The Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra looks like another incremental upgrade, and these rumored omissions have me concerned. Written by Prakhar Khanna, Contributing WriterContributing Writer Feb. 10, 2026 at 3:47 a.m. PT Reviewed by Elyse Betters Picaro Prakhar Khanna/ZDNETFollow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra was one of the most reliable phones launched last year. It had a big, sharp screen with a unique anti-reflective coating, powerful performance, and versatile cameras. However, I couldn't use it full-time because of an ergonomically poor design and an aging telephoto camera. Also: Samsung Unpacked 2026: 5 biggest rumors I'm seeing on Galaxy S26 Ultra, Buds 4 Pro, moreThere have been rumors pointing toward similar downsides for the Galaxy S26 Ultra. I'm concerned about Samsung's upcoming flagship phone. 1. Where's the telephoto camera upgrade? Kerry Wan/ZDNETAccording to ETNews, the Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra will have a 200MP primary camera, accompanied by a 50MP ultrawide lens, a 10MP 3x telephoto camera, and another 50MP 5x telephoto sensor. The 200MP camera is fully capable of shooting high-resolution images, but the 3x zoom camera is due for a big upgrade. Also: I changed 10 settings on my Samsung phone to significantly improve the user experienceSamsung has relied on the same sensor for 3x zoom capabilities for a couple of years now. It was weak last year, when Apple pushed the limits in videography with its 4x telephoto camera, and Chinese manufacturers had perfected portraits and macro shots with improved processing. If it is the same telephoto camera in 2026, it doesn't stand a chance against competitors. I hope Samsung updates the post-processing to improve the output from its 10MP sensor, but I'm not super optimistic. If the Galaxy S26 Ultra sticks with the same 3x telephoto camera, I'd advise more people to use the 200MP camera mode and crop photos later instead of zooming in on the viewfinder. 2. Please, just focus on the ergonomics Kerry Wan/ZDNETLast year, Samsung slashed the weight of its Galaxy S25 Ultra to 218 grams -- a big feat for a mainstream flagship phone, especially since none of the $1,000-plus phones from Apple or Google weigh less than 230 grams. Despite a lighter design, it was harder to use than the heavier Galaxy S24 Ultra, which wasn't too comfortable due to its sharp corners, and the Galaxy S23 Ultra before that. The on-paper weight can be misleading because an unergonomic design can render a phone difficult to use in day-to-day life. That is exactly what happened with the Galaxy S25 Ultra. Also: Why the Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra's biggest upgrade won't be its camera or processor for meSamsung gave its flagship phone a boxy design, which looks good, and I like it, but it forgot to taper the edges on each side. As a result, when you hold the phone, its sides dig into your palm. Both the Apple iPhone 17 Pro and Google Pixel 10 Pro XL do better in this regard. If the latest leaks are any indication, the Galaxy S26 Ultra could feature the same sharp, flat sides as before. According to a now-removed video shared by leaker Evan Blass, the upcoming Samsung phone could retain the boxy look with flat sides. It looks similar to the Galaxy S25 Ultra, and I cannot say for sure whether the edges on both sides have been tapered. If not, I will be disappointed because I need my phones to be comfortable to hold without adding a case. 3. I hope the S26 Ultra isn't more expensive Kerry Wan/ZDNETThe Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra is not guaranteed to get a price hike, but rumors are split on whether it is going to cost the same as its predecessor or be more expensive. Samsung could be facing pressure from component price hikes, but the Galaxy S25 Ultra already cost $1,300 at launch. Also: Own a Samsung phone? Changing these 7 settings will extend its battery life by hoursTo put things into perspective, $1,300 for the base version is more than Apple and Google's big flagship phones. While Samsung has doubled the storage to 512GB for the same price as part of launch offers, it is still in a tough spot. Modest upgrades, but new tech is promising Samsung recently teased a new display privacy feature debuting with the Galaxy S26 Ultra. There is no official name for the feature yet, but it is expected to be called Privacy Display -- and it could be a big deal for both regular consumers and business users. It could work similarly to a privacy screen protector, which prevents strangers from snooping on your private data in public. Also: If these Samsung Galaxy S26 rumors are true, I might finally put my Google Pixel loyalty to restThe Korean company is said to achieve this through pixel-level light control, adjusting its OLED emission so that light only shines toward the user when the display is viewed straight on. It won't reduce the phone's overall brightness or color depth, unlike a physical privacy screen protector. I am looking forward to it the most. If Samsung can make a comfortable-to-hold phone, the Galaxy S26 Ultra has a lot going for it, despite some modest upgrades on paper. Featured Want local vibe coding?

Decent camera. Long software support. Nice AMOLED screen. Day-long battery life. Expandable storage.TIREDFrustratingly slow performance. No headphone jack.“Camera failed.” That was the first time I tried to look at a photo I captured on Samsung's $200 Galaxy A17 5G smartphone. I've now spent more than two weeks using it as my primary phone, and I can't wait to switch to something else.Yes, it's $200, so expectations shouldn't be high, but I didn't have as frustrating an experience with the same-priced Motorola Moto G (2026) I tested a month prior, and I'd argue you're better off waiting for a $300 phone to go on sale for an overall richer experience. It's unfortunate because the Galaxy A17 5G does have some great qualities, but you can't trust it to be reliable.Low MemoryPhotograph: Julian ChokkattuThe biggest problem with the Galaxy A17 is performance—it's powered by Samsung's Exynos 1330 chipset, but you can more specifically lay the blame on the limited 4 GB of RAM. International versions of this phone come with 8 GB of RAM, and I daresay they perform better. Many of the performance woes happen when you try to do one too many things simultaneously.Samsung Galaxy A17 5GRating: 5/10$200 $180 at Amazon$200 $180 at Best Buy$200 at SamsungThe worst offender is the simple swipe up from the bottom to go home or to switch to a previous app. With gesture navigation turned on, the Galaxy A17 constantly thought I wanted to trigger Google's Circle to Search feature, which would cause the phone to freeze and stutter until it finally loaded the capability. It was so bad that I eventually had to turn Circle to Search off.Forget trying to multitask. I'd be filling out a form or reading a story in Google Chrome, but if I switched to another app and then came back to what I was doing, the Galaxy A17 would often refresh the entire app again, causing me to lose progress and start over.Even notifications came through slowly sometimes. When I'd try to log into a service and get a one-time password for security, the texts would never come through until I actually loaded up the Messages app. Notifications from Google Home for my security cameras came through at first, but over time, they became sporadic, and sometimes never arrived despite seeing them on my other devices. Sometimes when I hit “Delete” on email notifications, the notification just stayed there unchanged.Photograph: Julian ChokkattuEven without juggling various tasks, performance is sluggish in general. You'll wait a full second or two after swiping down on the home screen just to see your notification drawer. App launches take a beat, and scrolling through Instagram is choppy despite the 90-Hz screen refresh rate. A lightweight game like Pako Forever was also very stuttery; playable, but not very enjoyable.There are moments when performance is perfectly manageable—after all, I have used this phone for more than two weeks, and it's not at the bottom of a lake (yet). But those lag spikes make it very inconsistent, and if there was a moment when I really needed to do something quick on my phone, I wouldn't trust the A17 to handle it.Samsung Galaxy A17 5GRating: 5/10$200 $180 at Amazon$200 $180 at Best Buy$200 at SamsungMy benchmark scores aligned with my real-world assessment. The A17 ranked slightly higher than Motorola's $200 Moto G in single-core performance, but much lower in multi-core performance, indicating that the Motorola device generally has it beat when you're juggling multiple apps. That makes sense, because I do not recall having as frustrating an experience with the Moto G when I tested it a month ago. Don't get me wrong, that phone is also very slow and annoying to use, but I wasn't this flabbergasted.The Good BitsI haven't had any issues with the 6.7-inch AMOLED display—it gets bright enough in sunny conditions, and it's sharp enough. The single mono speaker is serviceable, though it's easy to block when holding the phone in landscape orientation. There's a microSD card slot to expand on the 128 GB of storage, the phone is IP54-rated to withstand rain, contactless payments have worked OK, and the fingerprint sensor is reliable. GPS has been fine, though Google Maps can sometimes glitch out, especially if you try to do something else while navigating.I've dropped the A17 a few times (less than 2-foot drops), and it has held up surprisingly well, so it gets an A+ for durability. If it matters to you, there is no headphone jack here (Motorola retains it on the Moto G). It's also great to see that this phone will receive six years of software updates, far better than anything Motorola offers at this price. There's a good amount of bloatware you'll want to remove, but the software experience is otherwise similar to other Samsung phones. If you're a fan of One UI, you'll feel at home here.Samsung has stuffed a 5,000-mAh cell here, but battery life is rather unremarkable. It lasts a full day with average to heavy use, but if you use the phone sparingly, then it'll easily stay alive through a second day. There's no wireless charging, unsurprising for a budget phone, but 25-watt wired charging means it's not terribly slow to recharge.1 / 8ChevronChevronPhotograph: Julian ChokkattuMain camera.Samsung Galaxy A17 5GRating: 5/10$200 $180 at Amazon$200 $180 at Best Buy$200 at SamsungThe main 50-MP camera is where Samsung beats its Motorola peer more decisively. When it finally loads and takes the picture (be patient), the images it spits out are decently detailed and not too oversaturated. Things take a turn for the worse in low light, with significantly more grain and loss of detail in darker areas. Moving subjects in low light? Just forget about it. Overall, though, it's a passable camera. Just don't bother with the 5-MP ultrawide or 2-MP macro.If your budget is strictly limited to $200, I would buy the Moto G 2026 over the A17, even with its inferior screen and lackluster two-year Android OS upgrade policy; the Motorola looks much nicer and simply performs better. But I urge you to save just a little bit more cash. The smarter move is to be patient and wait for $300 smartphones, like the Moto G Power 2026, to inevitably go on sale. In a few months, expect it to dip below $250. Samsung will also likely release a $300 Galaxy A27—succeeding the Galaxy A26 from 2025—in a few months, and it will be a better buy if you can wait for a sale.Or you could just buy used and save yourself the frustration. Swappa, for example, has the Galaxy S23—just two generations behind—unlocked in good condition for $236. That's a flagship smartphone from 2023, meaning it'll deliver significantly better performance, not to mention a great camera system. Yes, the Galaxy A17 is a usable $200 smartphone, but do you really want something that's going to annoy you every single day?Samsung Galaxy A17 5GRating: 5/10$200 $180 at Amazon$200 $180 at Best Buy$200 at Samsung$200 $180 at Amazon$200 $180 at Best Buy$200 at Samsung"

Close Home Tech Services & Software Operating Systems Windows Your Windows PC has a secretly useful backup tool - here's how to access it Looking for a traditional yet flexible program to back up your personal files? Windows has a built-in tool you can use. Written by Lance Whitney, ContributorContributor Feb. 10, 2026 at 3:15 a.m. PT Reviewed by Elyse Betters Picaro Lance Whitney / Elyse Betters Picaro / ZDNETFollow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.ZDNET's key takeawaysWindows has a hidden backup tool in Windows 10 and 11.It can save files to discs, drives, or network locations.Deprecated by Microsoft, so expect occasional errors.Regularly backing up your files is always a good idea, just in case any important or irreplaceable ones go missing. For that, you can turn to a variety of programs. But Windows itself has a built-in backup tool that's simple and flexible. The catch is that you probably don't even know it exists.Named simply Windows Backup, this feature lets you choose which folders and files to back up. You can back up only select files or all your Windows folders. You're supposed to be able to include an entire system image in the backup in case you ever need to restore Windows in full. Also: How to upgrade an 'incompatible' Windows 10 PC to Windows 11 - 2 free optionsThe limitation here is that you can't save the system image on removable media. But you can always use the system image tool to do this separately. Further, you can save the backup to a recordable CD or DVD, an external hard drive, or a network location. You can also set the backup to run regularly. The tool works the same in Windows 10 and 11. Is there a catch?But as always, there is a hiccup here. This version of Windows Backup has since been deprecated by Microsoft, which means it's no longer supported or updated. As a result, you may encounter issues or errors when using the tool. In my experience, it generally works reliably. However, the last few times I tried using a network share as my backup destination, I received an error that the specified network location cannot be used. Although I confirmed that the network path, credentials, and other settings were correct, I still received the same error. I've seen posts from other Windows users complaining of the same problem. Your mileage may vary, but keep this in mind when choosing your backup destination. Also: Your Windows 11 PC has a secret emergency shutdown feature - here's how to use itTo add to the mystery, Microsoft offers a newer tool also known as Windows Backup. (Yes, Microsoft loves to use the same names across different products to confuse people.) The newer Windows Backup is designed to back up and restore certain files and settings. The main objective is to help you move from one PC to another. In contrast, the older legacy Windows Backup that I'm covering here operates more like traditional backup software. Both tools serve their purpose. But here's how the older, legacy Windows Backup works and how to use it to back up anything you want, to any location you want. 1. Prepare your destination media First, you'll want to set up the media for storing the backup. For this, you can choose a CD or DVD, an external USB drive, or a network share.

Close Home Tech Computing Laptops How much RAM do you really need in 2026? A Windows and Mac expert explains Considering a PC upgrade, but unsure about how much RAM to buy? Here's what a tech expert recommends. Written by Cesar Cadenas, Staff WriterStaff Writer Feb. 10, 2026 at 2:01 a.m. PT Reviewed by Kyle Kucharski Cesar Cadenas/ZDNETFollow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.ZDNET's key takeawaysRAM allows computers to run fast and optimally.16GB is now the standard for PCs and laptops.Heavy users may need more RAM. Know when to upgrade.I used to struggle when shopping for a new computer -- there's a lot to keep in mind. Over time, I learned to narrow it down to what I call the \"performance trifecta\" -- three main components you should be mindful of: processor, storage drive, and RAM. A good processor is the brain of the computer, and a lot of local storage means you'll have plenty of room for all your files.Also: RAM prices are ridiculous in 2026 - here's how my PC buying advice is changing this yearBut what about memory? It's a component many people fully understand (I was certainly a part of this group). RAM, or random access memory, is essentially a computer's short-term memory. Instead of saving data directly onto an SSD, the computer stores files temporarily in the RAM for quick access, resulting in faster performance. The higher the RAM (measured in Gigabytes, or GB), the more memory it has. There's a lot of information and differing opinions regarding RAM and how much you need on your computer. Should you opt for the laptop with the 32GB LPDDR5X RAM, or will 16GB be enough? I'm here to cut through all the fog and provide easy-to-understand advice on the amount of memory you should get. How much RAM do you need in 2026? Kyle Kucharski/ZDNETThe short answer: it depends on the operating system. For Windows machines, 16GB of RAM has become the operational minimum on new consumer laptops. Modern workloads have ramped up to such a degree that less RAM on a Windows device is fine, but it will limit you to everyday tasks like writing emails, internet browsing or watching YouTube videos. But let's be real here: the average worker is probably running dozens of tabs in their browser, a handful of apps in the background, and (possibly) generative AI, all of which demand memory power. In that sense, most people using their Windows laptops for work will want at least 16GB (for a value-driven, future-proof option) for a smooth user experience. Also: Skipping this PC maintenance step could cost you - here's the right way to clean your systemIf you're upgrading to Windows 11, Microsoft says the minimum requirements are 4GB of RAM, but I'd still recommend 16GB as the baseline standard. If you have more than that, even better, but for most PCs, Windows 11 should run about the same as older operating systems. Kyle Kucharski/ZDNETWhen it comes to MacBooks, things are a little bit different. Because Apple's machines are so optimized to handle daily workflows, 8GB of RAM goes a bit further than a stock laptop running Windows. In fact, it wasn't until fairly recently that Apple made 16GB the starting point with the new MacBook Air M4. MacBooks with 8GB are still solid machines for daily use, while more powerful models like the MacBook Pro and MacBook Pro Max offer substantial power with 24GB, 36GB, or more, making them some of the most powerful laptops on the market (and some of the priciest).Besides Windows and Macs, Chromebooks are a third category of consumer laptops that have seen a spike in popularity over the last few years due to their lower average price and lightweight operating system, ChromeOS.Also: My proven way to speed up Linux when RAM upgrades aren't worth it (and it's free to do)Because ChromeOS is so streamlined, Chromebooks can get along just fine with 8GB or even less, making them great machines for handling the basics like working out of the browser and having your Google Suite at your fingertips with snappy performance and a low price. The trade-off, however, is that you'll have less access to apps you'd otherwise find on Windows. All in all, it's true to say that the more memory you have, the better your computer should perform. But having too much RAM can also be a poor return on investment, because you end up spending money on a resource you hardly ever use to its full potential. It's like owning a big house but only using a few of the rooms. When buying a new laptop, I just recommend having a clear understanding of what you want to use it for -- that way, you can set realistic expectations about how much RAM you need. ZDNET RECOMMENDS M4 MacBook Air Apple's M4 MacBook Air raises the bar for ultraportable laptops with more default memory, better external display support, and higher overall performance. View at Best Buy ZDNET RECOMMENDS Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 Lenovo's Chromebook Plus 14 brings an OLED display and marathon battery to the Chromebook line. View at Best Buy What does DDR5 mean? Kyle Kucharski/ZDNETSometimes, when shopping for a computer, you'll see the letters \"DDR\" followed by a number. This is an acronym that stands for \"double data rate.\" Without getting too deep into the weeds, DDR is a type of technology that improves the data transfer speed from RAM to other components, such as the processor. There have been five main DDR generations so far, with the latest and fastest standard being DDR5. Similar to 16GB of memory, DDR technology has effectively become the new standard for RAM as users demand faster speeds. There are also variations of the technology. A notable version is LPDDR5X, which stands for low-power double data rate 5X, a more energy-efficient version of DDR5 designed specifically for mobile devices. Don't expect DDR6 RAM to be released for a computer near you anytime soon. We saw the JEDEC (Joint Electron Device Engineering Council) announce the release of LPDDR6 back in early July. The JEDEC is the organization that established DDR as a computer standard. The technology is available for manufacturers to implement in their devices, but whether or not it'll happen -- or how soon -- is yet to be seen. When should you upgrade? Jason Hiner/ZDNET16GB is fine for most cases, but if you're a gamer or creative professional, you should consider 32GB of RAM. More RAM will ensure that the games you play and the video editing apps you use for work run more smoothly. I have that amount for my personal computer, and I'm very happy with that setup because I don't just write. Also: I recommend this older Windows 11 laptop over some newer models - here's whyI also play games on my desktop, edit photographs and videos, and run virtual machines, among other things. It's a heavy workload that requires the correct amount of resources to operate; even then, I am considering upgrading my PC to have more. It's not uncommon for me to see my workload take up over 70% of my computer's total RAM. I consider anything above 32GB of memory excessive unless you're a specific type of user. If you're editing 8K videos or running heavy apps simultaneously, then you'll probably need 48GB or 64GB of RAM. A good laptop that can deliver would be something like the M4 MacBook Pro or the Dell Premium 16. These are solid, top-of-the-line machines capable of tackling tough workloads. I'm not the only one who recommends 32GB for gaming. Back in November 2025, Microsoft published a handy guide on how to optimize your gaming PC setup, and the post includes a recommendation for how much memory you should have. And wouldn't you know it -- Microsoft recommends 32GB of RAM for users who play resource-demanding titles or mod-heavy games. ZDNET RECOMMENDS Dell Premium 16 Built for demanding workloads, the Dell Premium 16 is especially well-suited for creative tasks like graphic design and 3D modeling. View at Dell Why should you trust me? I've been writing about both software and consumer electronics for almost 10 years now, and in that time, I've worked in many different settings, from the traditional office to the home office, and even someone's backyard. The remote experience has made me extremely selective about what I choose to make my main computer, as I want to ensure the devices I use can handle my day-to-day tasks. I'm on my computer all day, practically every day of the week.Also: I tested several AIO computers in 2026, and these are the best for your office setupI'm also at a point where I've tried just about every type of laptop on the market. I know which features and specs you should look out for when purchasing a new computer -- and which ones are not worth your time.The advice I have given is not a set of hard and fast rules. I just aim to provide a foundation of what you should look for in a laptop. What is best for you depends on your unique needs.

Some devices, like the Meta Quest 3, are entirely standalone, which means you don't need anything but the headset itself to use it. Other VR headsets need to be connected to a system from which it can draw power and run software. Some systems, like the HP Reverb G2, must connect to a PC, while others like the PS VR2 can connect to gaming consoles like the PS5. Most VR headsets come with the basic controllers you'll need to control actions and movement in virtual worlds.\n \nWhat's the difference between PC VR, Smartphone VR and Gaming Console VR?\n \nThe main difference between those three VR systems is the main machine that allows the VR headset to run. PC VR headsets require a PC, like a gaming laptop or desktop, to run, while smartphone and gaming console VR systems require smartphones and gaming consoles, respectively, to work.\n \nDo all VR headsets need a phone?\n \nNo, not all VR headsets need a phone to work.

    "summary": "I’m a longtime lover of pen and paper, so E Ink tablets have been intriguing to me ever since they started becoming more widely available. After having hundreds of half-filled notebooks over the years, I, at some point, turned to digital tools instead because it was just easier to store everything on my phone or laptop so I always had my most important information at my fingertips.\nE-Ink tablets seem to provide the best of both worlds: the tactile satisfaction of regular notebooks with many of the conveniences found in digital tools, plus easy-on-the-eyes E-Ink screens. These devices have come a long way in recent years — now you can find them in multiple sizes, some have color E Ink screens and others double as full-blow ereaders with access to ebook stores and your local library’s offerings. I’ve tested out close to a dozen E Ink tablets over the past few years to see how well they work, how convenient they really are and which are the best tablets using E Ink screens available today.\n \nBest E Ink tablets for 2026\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \nAre E Ink tablets worth it?\n \nAn E Ink tablet will be a worthwhile purchase to a very select group of people. If you prefer the look and feel of an e paper display to LCD panels found on traditional tablets, it makes a lot of sense. They’re also good options for those who want a more paper-like writing experience (although you can get that kind of functionality on a regular tablet with the right screen protector) or a more distraction-free device overall.\n \nThe final note is key here. Many E Ink tablets don’t run on the same operating systems as regular tablets, so you’re automatically going to be limited in what you can do. And even with those that do allow you to download traditional apps like Chrome, Instagram and Facebook, E Ink tablets are not designed to give you the best casual-browsing experience. This is mostly due to the nature of E Ink displays, which have noticeable refreshes, a lack of vibrant colors and lower picture quality than the panels you’ll find on even the cheapest iPad.\n \nArguably the biggest reason why you wouldn’t want to go with an iPad (all models of which support stylus input, a plethora of reading apps, etc) is because it’s much easier to get distracted by email, social media and other Internet-related temptations.\n \nWhat to look for in an E Ink tablet\n \nWriting and latency\n \nArguably the most important thing to consider when looking for an E Ink tablet is the writing experience. How good it is will depend a lot on the display’s refresh rate (does it refresh after every time you put pen to “paper,” or at a different regular interval) and the stylus’ latency. Most of the tablets I’ve tested have little to no latency, but some are certainly better than others. Finally, you should double check before buying that your preferred E Ink tablet comes with a stylus, or if you need to purchase one separately.\n \nReading\n \nHow much will you be reading books, documents and other things on this tablet? E Ink tablets come in many sizes, but most of them tend to be larger than your standard e-reader because it makes writing much easier. Having a larger display isn’t a bad thing, but it might make holding it for long periods slightly more uncomfortable. (Most e-readers are roughly the size of a paperback book, giving you a similar feeling to analog reading).\n \nThe supported file types for e-books can also make a big difference. It’s hard to make a blanket statement here because this varies so much among E Ink tablets. The TL;DR is that you’ll have a much better reading experience if you go with one made by a company that already has a history in e-book sales (i.e. Amazon or Kobo). All of the titles you bought via the Kindle or Kobo store should automatically be available to you on your Kindle or Kobo E Ink tablet.\n \nAlso with Kindle titles, specifically, since they are protected by DRM, it’s not necessarily the best idea to try to bring those titles over to a third-party device. Unless the tablet runs an operating system like Android that supports downloads for apps like Kindle and Kobo, you’ll be limited to supported file types, like ePUB, PDF, MOBI, JPEG, PNG and others.\n \nSearch functionality\n \nMost E Ink tablets have some on-device search features, but they can vary widely between models. You’ll want to consider how important it is to you to be able to search through all your handwritten notes and markups. I noticed in my testing that Amazon’s and Kobo’s E Ink tablets made it easy to refer back to notes made in books and files because they automatically save to the specific pages on which you took notes, made highlights and more.\n \nSearching is less standardized on E Ink tablets that have different supported file types, but their features can be quite powerful in their own right. For example, a few devices I tested supported text search in handwritten notes along with handwriting recognition, the latter of which allows you to translate your scribbles into typed text.\n \nSharing and connectivity\n \nWhile we established that E Ink tablets can be great distraction-free devices, most manufacturers understand that your notes and doodles aren’t created in a vacuum. You may want to access them elsewhere, and that requires some form of connectivity. All of the E Ink tablets I tried have Wi-Fi support, and some support cloud syncing, companion mobile apps and the ability to export notes via email so you can access them elsewhere.\n \nNone of them, however, integrate directly with a digital note taking system like Evernote or OneNote, so these devices will always be somewhat supplementary if you use apps like that, too. I’d argue that, if you already lean heavily on apps like OneNote, a standard tablet with a stylus and screen protector might be the best way to go. Ultimately, you should think about what you will want to do with the documents you’ll interact with on your E Ink tablet after the tablet portion is done.\n \nPrice\n \nE Ink tablets aren’t known for being cheap. They generally fall into the $300-$800 price range, which is what you can expect to pay for a solid regular tablet, too. A key factor in price is size: cheaper devices with E Ink displays are likely to have smaller screens, and stylus support isn’t as much of a given. Also, those types of devices are generally considered e-readers because of their size and may not be the best for note-taking, doodling and the like.\n \nE Ink tablets have gone up in price recently. Supernote and Onyx Boox increased prices, as did reMarkable. The former said it was due to \"increased costs,” and a reMarkable representative confirmed this to Engadget and provided the following statement: \"We regularly review our pricing based on market conditions and operational costs. We've communicated an upcoming adjustment for the US market effective in May to provide transparency to our customers. Multiple factors influence our pricing decisions, including supply chain dynamics and overall operational costs in specific markets.”\n \nAs a result, the reMarkable Paper Pro jumped from $579 to $629 (that's for the bundle with the standard Marker and no Folio). This isn't great, considering the Paper Pro was already on the expensive side of the spectrum for E Ink tablets. It's also worth noting that Supernote and Onyx Boox have raised prices in the past few months as well.\n \nOther E Ink tablets we've tested\n \nOnyx Boox Tab X C\n \nThe Boox Tab X C is a color-screened version of the Tab X, the company’s all-purpose e-paper Android tablet. The Tab X C has a lovely 13.3-inch Kaleido 3 E Ink color display, an octa-core processor, 6GB of RAM and it runs on Android 13, making it one of the most powerful tablets in Boox’s lineup. I’ve used the Tab X in the past and this color version runs similarly, if not better, and at 5.3mm thick, it’s impressively svelte even when you pair it with its folio keyboard case. As someone who loves legal-pad sized things to write on, I also like how the Tab X C is most akin to A4-size paper. But at $820 for the bundle with the standard case (or a whopping $970 for the tablet and its keyboard case), it’s really only best for those who are ready to go all-in on a premium E Ink tablet.\n \nLenovo Smart Paper\n \nLenovo made a solid E Ink tablet in the Smart Paper, but it's too pricey and too married to the company's companion cloud service to warrant a spot on our top picks list. The hardware is great, but the software isn't as flexible as those of competitors like the reMarkable 2. It has good Google Drive integration, but you must pair it with Lenovo's cloud service to really get the most use out of it — and in the UK, the service costs £9 per month for three months, which is quite expensive.\n \nOnyx Boox Tab Ultra\n \nThe Boox Tab Ultra has a lot of the same features we like in the Note Air 2 Plus, but it’s designed to be a true, all-purpose tablet with an E Ink screen. Running Android 11 and compatible with a magnetic keyboard case, you can use it like a standard 2-in-1 laptop, albeit a low-powered one. You can browse the web, check email and even watch YouTube videos on this thing — but that doesn’t mean you should. A standard 2-in-1 laptop with a more responsive screen and better overall performance would be a better fit for most people who even have the slightest desire to have an all-in-one device. Like the rest of Onyx’s devices, the Tab Ultra is specifically for those who put reading and eye comfort above all else.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/tablets/best-e-ink-tablet-130037939.html?src=rss",

Cannon said the company's plans for its 2026 competitive season have not altered with the layoffs.

Several apps that allowed people to share information about where they had seen ICE members were removed from both Apple's App Store and Google's Play Store in October. Politico reported that Raskin has contacted Attorney General Pam Bondi on the issue and also questioned the agency's use of force against protestors as it executes the immigration policy set by President Donald Trump. \n\"The coercion and censorship campaign, which ultimately targets the users of ICE-monitoring applications, is a clear effort to silence this Administration’s critics and suppress any evidence that would expose the Administration’s lies, including its Orwellian attempts to cover up the murders of Renee and Alex,\" Raskin wrote to Bondi. He refers to Minneapolis residents Renee Good and Alex Pretti, who were both fatally shot by ICE agents. In the two separate incidents, claims made by federal leaders about the victims and the circumstances of their deaths were contradicted by eyewitnesses or camera footage, echoing violent interactions and lies about them that occurred while ICE conducted raids in Chicago several months ago. \nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apps/doj-may-face-investigation-for-pressuring-apple-google-to-remove-apps-for-tracking-ice-agents-212145181.html?src=rss",

Instead, the commercial scared the pants off of anyone concerned about a mass surveillance state.\nThe feature is advertised as a way to reunite missing dogs with their owners, a noble cause indeed, but Search Party does this by turning individual Ring devices into a surveillance network. Each camera uses AI to identify pets running across its field of vision and all feeds are pooled together to potentially identify lost animals.

Search Party was first announced last year. In that time it has been used to find 99 lost dogs in 90 days of use, according to Amazon CEO Andy Jassy. Approximately ten million pets go missing in America each year. Many people aren't keen on helping to create a surveillance state for a tool with what looks to be around a 0.005 percent success rate.

    "summary": "Most microSD cards are fast enough for boosting storage space and making simple file transfers, but some provide a little more value than others. If you’ve got a device that still accepts microSD cards — whether it’s an older gaming handheld, the new Nintendo Switch 2, a dash cam, a drone or an Android tablet — we’ve scoured the market and put close to 20 top contenders through a number of benchmark tests. You can find our recommendations for the best microSD cards below, alongside some general shopping advice worth knowing before you buy.\n \nBest microSD cards of 2026\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \nBest microSD Express cards for the Nintendo Switch 2\n \n\n \n \n \n \nRead our full guide to the best microSD Express cards for the Nintendo Switch 2\n \nLet’s be clear about this: Unless you plan to own a Nintendo Switch 2 in the near future, you do not need a high-speed microSD Express card just yet. Nintendo’s gaming handheld is the only popular device that natively supports this standard right now, and microSD Express cards themselves are highly expensive compared to more traditional options.\n \nStill, if you do want to increase a Switch 2’s storage, they’re your only choice. Fortunately, determining exactly which model to buy for the console is pretty straightforward: Get whichever one you can find in stock, in the capacity you want, at a price you can stomach.\n \nWe benchmarked several microSD Express cards for a separate Switch 2 guide, and for the most part, the performance differences between them weren’t great enough to justify paying extra for any particular model. Loading times weren’t quite identical with every test we ran, but the cards were extremely close in most games and common scenarios. The few times when there was a notable gap — fast-traveling to a particularly resource-heavy region in Cyberpunk 2077, for instance — the gulf between the slowest and fastest card was only ever about four or five seconds at most. That’s not nothing, but it’s also not something most people are likely to fret over unless they have a stopwatch handy.\n \n\n \n \n  The SanDisk microSD Express Card and Lexar Play Pro.\n \n \n \nThe only time you’d notice a major speed difference is if you transfer games to your Express card from the Switch 2’s internal storage (and vice versa). In that case, the SanDisk microSD Express Card and Lexar Play Pro were generally the quickest, while PNY’s microSD Express Flash Memory Card had particularly slow write speeds.\n \nMoving Mario Kart World to the SanDisk and Lexar models, for example, took around four minutes and 35 seconds on average; with the PNY card, it took a little over seven minutes. That said, the PNY model was the fastest when it came to moving games back to the system storage. Walmart’s Onn microSD Express Card was significantly slower to move games from the card to system storage, but it’s also the most affordable card we’ve seen by a good distance. Either way, most people aren’t constantly shuffling their games back and forth like this. Performance in actual games is more important, and in that regard the results were consistently much tighter.\n \nWhat matters most is getting the most space for your budget. Unfortunately, stock for all microSD Express cards has been spotty since the Switch 2’s launch. For your convenience, we’ll list out all of the models we’ve tested thus far and their respective list prices below. Note that some lower-capacity versions — the 128GB SanDisk card, for one — advertise slower speeds than their more spacious counterparts.\n \n \n \nSanDisk microSD Express Card: 128GB ($64), 256GB ($78), 512GB ($128)\n \n \nLexar Play Pro: 256GB ($60), 512GB ($120), 1TB ($220)\n \n \nPNY microSD Express Flash Memory Card: 128GB ($48), 256GB ($62), 512GB ($124)\n \n \nSamsung microSD Express Card for Nintendo Switch 2: 256GB ($60)\n \n \nSamsung P9 Express: 256GB ($55), 512GB ($100)\n \n \nGameStop Express microSD Card for Nintendo Switch 2: 256GB ($60), 512GB ($100), 1TB ($190)\n \n \nWalmart Onn microSDXC Express Card: 256GB ($47), 512GB ($85)\n \n \n\n \n \n  The Lexar Play Pro on top of Lexar's RW540 microSD Express card reader.\n \n \n \nBroadly speaking, we recommend getting at least 256GB of storage, as Switch 2 games tend to have much larger file sizes than games for Nintendo’s previous handheld. But we also recommend holding off upgrading for as long as you can, if only because all of these cards should (tariff shenanigans aside) come down in price as time goes on.\n \nThere’s no point in buying a microSD Express card for anything besides the Switch 2, but we did run the models above through our usual PC benchmarks as well. Unsurprisingly, they are miles faster than any traditional card on the market.\n \nWith the 256GB SanDisk card, for instance, sequential read speeds checked in just under 900 MB/s in CrystalDiskMark and ATTO, while sequential writes topped out around 650 MB/s. Sustained writes speeds were slower (around 210 MB/s), but that was still fast enough to move our 12GB test file to the card in 52 seconds on average. It took a mere 20 seconds to read the file back to our PC. The write test with our smaller 1.15GB test folder, meanwhile, averaged just 4.5 seconds.\n \nIt all adds up to performance that's at least twice as fast as the best UHS-I models we’ve tested in terms of sequential reads and writes, with three or four times the speeds in some cases. The gulf in random reads and writes is similar, and in some benchmarks even greater. But you need a pricey SD card reader to even see those increases on a PC, so only those with a Switch 2 in hand or serious cash to burn should consider one of these things.\n \nOther notable microSD cards\n \n\n \n \n \nSamsung Pro Ultimate\n \nThe Samsung Pro Ultimate was the closest competitor to the Lexar Professional Silver Plus across our benchmark tests, but it's tangibly worse in terms of sequential write speeds, typically costs more and doesn’t offer a 1TB option. The Samsung Pro Plus is a bit slower for sequential reads, but it’s close enough otherwise and usually easier to find at a lower price.\n \nLexar Professional Gold\n \nWe haven't used it ourselves, but if you’re willing to pay for a more powerful UHS-II card built for heavy-duty video recording, the Lexar Professional Gold has tested well elsewhere and should deliver significantly faster sequential write speeds than our UHS-I picks above. It’s one of the few UHS-II cards we could actually find in stock, but it’s pricey, with a 128GB model normally priced in the $35 to $40 range.\n \n\n \n \n \nSanDisk Extreme\n \nThe SanDisk Extreme effectively matched the Pro Plus in a few of our sequential tests, but that was partly due to us only being able to secure the 256GB model, which is higher-rated than the 128GB version. It’s a fine choice if you see it on sale at a reputable seller, but it’s broadly slower than our top pick and often costs more.\n \nSanDisk GamePlay\n \nThe SanDisk GamePlay performs similarly to the SanDisk Extreme but costs a good bit extra as of our latest update. We couldn’t get it to reach its advertised speeds with the company’s own “Pro” card reader or other third-party options, so it fell short of our top picks.\n \nSanDisk Pokémon\n \nThe SanDisk Pokémon does outperform its advertised read and write speeds, but not by enough to outpace the Lexar Silver Plus or Samsung Pro Plus. It essentially charges extra for having a picture of Pikachu (or Gengar, or Snorlax) on a product you’ll never look at.\n \n\n \n \n \nSanDisk Extreme Pro\n \nThe SanDisk Extreme Pro is a close analog to the Samsung Pro Ultimate but, as of this writing, is either unavailable at most trusted retailers or priced too high by comparison. The Lexar Professional Silver Plus has faster sequential write speeds as well.\n \nPNY XLR8 Gaming\n \nThe PNY XLR8 is an affordable card that comes with up to 512GB of space. Its sequential and random writes speeds checked in a little bit above those of Samsung’s Evo Select, plus it comes with a lifetime warranty. But its sequential reads were much, much slower, putting it out of contention.\n \nPNY Elite-X\n \nThe PNY Elite-X often goes for cheap and wasn’t too far off the random read/write performance of Samsung's Pro Plus in CrystalDiskMark. Like the XLR8, it’s also slightly above the Evo Select in write speeds. But its sequential reads were too far behind all of our top picks, and it no longer appears to be available in capacities above 256GB.\n \nWhat to look for in a microSD card\n \nCapacity\n \nThe first thing to figure out when buying a microSD card is how much storage space you need. Modern cards are commonly available in sizes ranging from 32GB to 512GB, with several models now available in 1TB or 1.5TB capacities as well. The first 2TB cards from major brands have started to arrive as well, which is exciting, but those are still fairly rare (and very expensive) by comparison.\n \nFor many, a 128GB or 256GB model should be a sweet spot between price and storage space. But if you need more room — say, for stashing a bunch of games on a Steam Deck — a 512GB card or greater could make more sense and often provides a better cost-per-GB ratio. \n \nPricing and stock levels are all over the place as of our most recent update thanks to ongoing AI-driven shortages, but you can typically still find a decent 128GB card for around $15, a good 256GB card for less than $30 and a solid 512GB card for around $40 (with faster models priced a little higher). There’s a starker increase when you go up to 1TB cards, which often cost closer to $100, though we’ve seen some fall into the $70 to $80 range over the last year. The first 2TB cards are a bigger leap: the 2TB SanDisk Extreme, for example, currently has a list price around $290, which is way up from what we saw in 2025.\n \nNote that a microSD card’s performance may differ depending on what capacity you buy. SanDisk says its 128GB Extreme card delivers sequential write speeds up to 90 MB/s, for example, while the higher-capacity models in the same line offer up to 130 MB/s.\n \nWhen we talk about microSD cards today, we mostly refer to cards that use the microSDXC (eXtended Capacity) standard, which have a capacity between 32GB and 2TB. Your device needs to support this for it to work with a microSDXC card. This will almost never be an issue these days, but some older devices (a Nintendo 3DS, for instance) are only compatible with microSDHC (High Capacity) cards, which range from 2GB to 32GB.\n \n\n \n \n \nRead and write speeds\n \nMicroSD cards are primarily judged on their read and write speeds, which are usually measured in megabytes per second (MB/s). Generally, most microSD cards have faster read speeds than write speeds.\n \nThese metrics can then be broken down into sequential and random performance. Sequential read and write speeds matter when you’re trying to access (read) or save (write) long, constant streams of data, such as opening a large video or copying a big batch of files from a PC. If you want to use a microSD card for media storage, this is particularly important. Random performance, meanwhile, is about how quickly a card can read and write small files scattered throughout the device.\n \nSince random read/write speeds are much lower than sequential ones, storage device makers tend not to advertise them as loudly. But they’re important if you use a card with a gaming device or a single-board computer like the Raspberry Pi, where it often has to rapidly save and access small bits of data in random locations.\n \n\n \n \n \nSpeed ratings\n \nIf you look at a microSD card, you’ll see a buffet of numbers, letters and symbols. Most of these refer to the card’s speed class and performance ratings, which are determined by the SD Association.\n \nA card’s Video Speed Class, or V-rating, details its minimum sequential write speed, which is especially important when recording video from a camera. It ranges from V6 to V90. Most of the cards we tested had a V30 rating, so they have a sequential write speed of at least 30 MB/s. This should be enough to support up to 4K video at lower bitrates. Higher-rated V60 and V90 cards are usually better for capturing 8K, but they come at a much higher cost.\n \nThe UHS Speed Class, or U-rating, also refers to a card’s minimum sequential write speed. It comes in two varieties: U3, which mandates a minimum of 30 MB/s, and U1, which is rated for 10 MB/s.\n \nThe older Speed Class rating overlaps with the other two systems. It’s signified by a C symbol and goes from Class 2 to Class 10, with the number (again) indicating minimum sequential write speed. This rating is less relevant nowadays, but you may still see a “C10” logo on some cards.\n \nThe Application Performance spec, marked by an A symbol, is an indicator of random read/write speeds. This is measured in IOPS, or input/output operations per second, rather than MB/s. There are two categories here: A1 cards offer a minimum random read speed of 1,500 IOPS and a minimum random write speed of 500 IOPS, while A2 cards bump those up to 4,000 IOPS and 2,000 IOPS, respectively. Both ratings also guarantee sequential write speeds of at least 10 MB/s.\n \nTo keep it simple, most people should look for a card with V30, U3 and A2 ratings. It’s totally possible to get a solid card without those: A U1 card might be worth it if you just need a cheap, high-capacity option, for example. V60 and V90 cards are worth a look if you’re serious about shooting high-resolution photos and video as well. But overall, cards with the certifications above should provide the best blend of price and performance today.\n \nIt’s important to emphasize that these ratings are baselines. Most V30 cards offer significantly higher write speeds than 30 MB/s, for instance, and some A1 cards can outperform some A2 models in practice. The speeds advertised by manufacturers aren’t always 100 percent accurate, either: Sometimes the card will be slower in real-world use, other times it may actually be a bit faster.\n \n\n \n \n \n \nUHS bus speeds\n \nThe other spec to note is the card’s bus interface. Most microSD cards available today are UHS-I, which has a theoretical maximum speed of 104 MB/s. There are also UHS-II cards, which have an extra row of pins on the back and can reach up to 312 MB/s. (A UHS-III standard technically exists as well but hasn’t seen wide adoption.) These are labeled on the card with a Roman numeral I or II.\n \nUHS-II cards are typically the ones with those higher V60 or V90 ratings. If you shoot lots of 4K to 8K video or frequently use burst mode to capture ultra high-res photos, the performance gains of a good UHS-II card can save you time.\n \nHowever, these are typically much more expensive than UHS-I cards: This 128GB Lexar Professional Gold model, for instance, is a relative bargain at $35. While that's less than many UHS-II models we’ve seen in the past, it's still more than double the common street price of our top pick above. You need a device that’s compatible with the UHS-II interface to see any benefits, too, and stock for UHS-II cards is often spottier. For now, the higher speeds aren’t worth the price premium for most people, so we stuck mostly to UHS-I cards with our recommendations.\n \n\n \n \n  Unlike traditional UHS-I cards, a microSD Express card like the SanDisk model on the right comes with a second row of pins to enable its improved performance.\n \n \n \nmicroSD Express and the Nintendo Switch 2\n \nThe absolute fastest microSD cards you can buy, however, are based on a different interface called SD Express. This has technically been around for several years and now includes its own subset of speed classes, but the gist is that it's much faster than UHS-I or UHS-II: SanDisk’s recently released microSD Express card, one of the first commercially available models, advertises sequential read speeds up to 880MB/s. That’s quicker than some older SSDs.\n \nIt’s a substantial upgrade that has largely held up in our testing, but very few popular devices natively support SD Express today. The first major exception is the Nintendo Switch 2, which is only compatible with the newer standard, as it’s needed to keep up with the performance demands of new handheld games.\n \nBesides SanDisk, manufacturers like Samsung, Lexar and PNY have already launched microSD Express cards to go with the console. The presumption is that having such a popular device embrace the tech will only further its adoption and drive prices down.\n \nBut it’s still early days, and right now all microSD Express cards cost much more than the best UHS-I or even UHS-II options. Beyond the Switch 2, it’s possible to take advantage of these cards’ superior speeds with a dedicated SD Express card reader, but that adds even more to the final cost. It’s also worth noting that SD Express cards are not backwards compatible with UHS-II (or UHS-III), so if you try to plug one into a device with a UHS-II slot, it’ll be limited to UHS-I speeds. Still, they’re a must for Nintendo fans going forward, and the tech should have plenty of appeal if more gadgets that support the interface do arrive. \n \nFor more on how the first wave of Express cards perform on the Switch 2, we've put together a dedicated buying guide just for Nintendo's console. \n \n\n \n \n \nA note on card readers and reaching advertised speeds\n \nWhile the UHS-I interface has a theoretical maximum of 104 MB/s, some UHS-I cards can exceed that speed through proprietary extensions. However, you need a compatible card reader and host device to take advantage of that extra performance. If you find a UHS-I card advertising speeds higher than 104 MB/s, this is what’s going on. You can see these limits in action with an original Nintendo Switch or Steam Deck: Both of those gaming devices support the UHS-I interface but don’t go beyond its official speed, flattening any sequential gains some cards may have elsewhere. (Differences in random read and write speeds can still matter, though.) The same thing will happen if you plug a more powerful UHS-II or SD Express card into a device that doesn’t accept those interfaces.\n \nThe takeaway: Your microSD card will only be as fast as the slowest link in your chain.\n \nWarranty\n \nMany microSD cards are designed to be durable, with protection from water, extreme temperatures, X-rays and drops. Still, in case of catastrophe, a long warranty is always good to have. Many manufacturers offer lifetime or 10-year limited warranties, though we’ve noticed that “endurance” cards marketed to withstand more hours of writing are usually covered for a shorter period of time. For example, Samsung's Pro Endurance, a model aimed at security cameras and other monitoring devices, comes with a five-year warranty.\n \nAvoiding counterfeits\n \nThe memory card market has had a particular problem with scammers selling fake products. To guard against this, only buy from a known brand and a reputable retailer such as Best Buy, B&H Photo or Adorama. If you shop at Amazon, only buy if the shipper and seller is Amazon.com. (That said, a handful of users have reported receiving counterfeits even from Amazon directly in the past, so exercise caution.) Remember: If a price seems too good to be true, it probably is. Be wary of any retailer offering a significantly lower price than everyone else.\n \nOnce you receive a card, check its packaging for any irregularities. You can run benchmark tests like CrystalDiskMark or BlackMagic Disk Speed Test to verify its speeds aren’t drastically lower than what’s advertised (or possible, given its specs). You can also use software that’s designed to verify the true capacity and performance of your card, such as H2testw and FakeFlashTest.\n \n\n \n \n  A few of the microSD card readers we've used for testing.\n \n \n \nHow we test microSD cards\n \nWe've put about 20 microSD cards through a series of tests to verify their sequential and random performance. These included benchmarks like CrystalDiskMark, BlackMagic Disk Speed Test, ATTO Disk Benchmark and AJA System Test, as well as a few “real-world” tests. We copied and pasted a small folder of photos about 1.15GB in size to and from each card, then did the same with a larger 12.2GB folder containing multiple file types and subfolders, timing the process each time. We also checked how each card performed on the Steam Deck, downloading games of varying sizes — including Stardew Valley, Aperture Desk Job, Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance and Apex Legends — then timing how long it took to launch each game and load save files. We do multiple runs of each test to verify our findings and account for potential outliers. \n \nWhere applicable, we used a Kingston USB 3.2 UHS-II reader to test each card on both Windows 11 and macOS Sequoia. However, if a card could be bundled with (or is specifically advertised to use) a proprietary reader, we mainly tested with that, since we figure that’s the one most interested buyers will end up using. For Windows testing, we used an Alienware gaming PC with an Intel Core i9-10900F, Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 GPU, 32GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD. For macOS, we used a 2021 16-inch MacBook Pro with an Apple M1 Pro chip, 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD. If a reader couldn’t connect over USB-C, we used CalDigit’s TS4 dock to test the corresponding card on the MacBook.\n \nWe tested the 128GB version of each card whenever we could, though we were only able to test higher-capacity models for a few options. We also reformatted each card before testing with the SD Association’s Memory Card Formatter tool.\n \nFor microSD Express cards, we ran each model through a series of tests specific to the Switch 2, since that is the only popular device that actually supports the tech. You can read more about that process in our separate buying guide linked above.\n \nRecent updates\n \nDecember 2025: We’ve tested the Samsung P9 Express microSD Express card and noted it in our Switch 2 section above. We’ve also made a few edits to highlight recent price increases and stock shortages driven by the ongoing AI boom.\n \nNovember 2025: We’ve tested Walmart’s Onn microSD Express Card and edited our notes on the best cards for the Nintendo Switch 2 accordingly.\n \nSeptember 2025: We’ve fleshed out our advice on buying a microSD Express card for the Nintendo Switch 2. \n \nMay 2025: We’ve updated this guide to ensure our advice is accurate and to reflect the new Nintendo Switch 2’s use of microSD Express cards. We’ve also added testing notes for the Lexar Play Pro microSD Express card and the more standard PNY XLR8. We’ve removed mentions of a few cards that have seemingly been discontinued, including the original Kingston Canvas Go Plus, the Lexar Professional 1066x and the 2021 Samsung Evo Select. We plan to test more new microSD Express cards for a future update.\n \nFebruary 2025: We’ve updated this guide with a new top pick: the Lexar Professional Silver Plus. The Samsung Pro Plus, our previous recommendation, stays as a runner-up. We’ve also added SanDisk’s recently released microSD Express card as a pick for those who want the absolute fastest card possible, albeit with heavy caveats. This is one of the first microSD cards to use the SD Express bus interface, so we’ve included more details on what that entails in our “what to look for in a microSD card” section. Lastly, we’ve removed our write-up for SanDisk’s Apex Legends card, as it appears to have been discontinued, and included testing notes for a couple of the company’s more recent releases.\n \nNovember 2024: We've checked back with this guide to ensure our recommendations are still accurate and made light edits for clarity. \n \nAugust 2024: We’ve updated this guide to note the recently released 1TB models for three of our top picks: the Samsung Pro Plus, the Kingston Canvas Go Plus and the Samsung Evo Select. We’ve also made sure all pricing details are as up to date as they can be. \nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-microsd-card-130038282.html?src=rss",

You can get the lowest price that we’ve seen on select colors, including black, gray, white, and its matcha green gradient option for around $24 (originally $36.99) at Amazon when you enter the code YX2SATAXQVMO at checkout. It’s the only case that I’ve tested that includes some padding near the top of the Switch 2 system to keep it from moving around in the event of a drop. Here’s my buying guide covering this and other great Switch 2 cases.\nEthernet switches don’t have to cost you a lot of money. My needs are met by this eight-port TP-Link gigabit switch that’s under $20. However, it’s possible that you’re you’re paying a lot for fast internet service and you really want to make sure you’re getting your money’s worth. If that’s the case, Netgear’s five-port switch, which supports up to 2.5-gigabit connections, is back to its lowest price at Amazon, costing $69.99. Outside this discount, which has only happened once before during January, it costs $99.99.\nWoot has a nice deal on a new AMD Ryzen 9 7900X desktop processor. The 2022 CPU typically costs $350 at most retailers, but you can purchase it for $239.99 while supplies last. It’s a great deal if you’re assembling a capable gaming PC while trying to save as much money as possible. This processor must be paired with a motherboard that has an AM5 socket. Unlike Intel’s strategy of shifting sockets every couple of generations, AM5 is still being used by AMD processors. In other words, you can upgrade later to an 8000 or 9000-series CPU without having to completely uproot your build.",

That’s where Apple’s iPhone Air MagSafe battery pack comes in, and it’s currently on sale for $79.\n \n\n \n \nThis accessory only works with the iPhone Air, but much like the phone it attaches to, it’s extremely slim at 7.5mmm, so crucially doesn’t add so much bulk when attached that it defeats the point of having a thin phone in the first place.

Most sources now point to fall 2026, likely alongside the iPhone 18 lineup.\nMark Gurman has gone back and forth on timing, initially suggesting Apple could launch “as early as 2026,” before later writing that the device would ship at the end of 2026 and sell primarily in 2027. Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has also repeatedly cited the second half of 2026 as Apple’s target.\nSome reports still claim the project could slip into 2027 if Apple runs into manufacturing or durability issues, particularly around the hinge or display. Given Apple’s history of delaying products that it feels aren’t ready, that remains a real possibility.\nWhat will the iPhone Fold look like?\nCurrent consensus suggests Apple has settled on a book-style foldable design, similar to Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold series, rather than a clamshell flip phone.\nWhen unfolded, the iPhone Fold is expected to resemble a small tablet like the iPad mini (8.3 inches). Based on the rumor mill, though, the iPhone Fold may be a touch smaller, with an internal display measuring around 7.7 to 7.8 inches. When closed, it should function like a conventional smartphone, with an outer display in the 5.5-inch range.\nCAD leaks and alleged case-maker molds suggest the device may be shorter and wider than a standard iPhone when folded, creating a squarer footprint that better matches the aspect ratio of the inner display. Several reports have also pointed to the iPhone Air as a potential preview of Apple’s foldable design work, with its unusually thin chassis widely interpreted as a look at what one half of a future foldable iPhone could resemble.\nIf that theory holds, it could help explain the Fold’s rumored dimensions. Thickness is expected to land between roughly 4.5 and 5.6mm when unfolded, putting it in a similar range to the iPhone Air, and just over 9 to 11mm when folded, depending on the final hinge design and internal layering.\niPhone 17 Pro, iPhone Air\nEngadget\n\nDisplay and the crease question\nThe display is arguably the biggest challenge for any foldable phone, and it’s an area where Apple appears to have invested years of development.\nMultiple reports say Apple will rely on Samsung Display as its primary supplier. At CES 2026, Samsung showcased a new crease-less foldable OLED panel, which several sources — including Bloomberg — suggested could be the same technology Apple plans to use.\nAccording to these reports, the panel combines a flexible OLED with a laser-drilled metal support plate that disperses stress when folding. The goal is a display with a nearly invisible crease, something Apple reportedly considers essential before entering the foldable market.\nIf Apple does use this panel, it would mark a notable improvement over current foldables, which still show visible creasing under certain lighting conditions.\nCameras and biometrics\nCamera rumors suggest Apple is planning a four-camera setup. That may include:\n\nTwo rear cameras (main and ultra-wide, both rumored at 48MP)\n\nOne punch-hole camera on the outer display\n\nOne under-display camera on the inner screen\n\nSeveral sources claim Apple will avoid Face ID entirely on the iPhone Fold. Instead, it’s expected to rely on Touch ID built into the power button, similar to recent iPad models. This would allow Apple to keep both displays free of notches or Dynamic Island cutouts.\nUnder-display camera technology has historically produced lower image quality, but a rumored 24MP sensor would be a significant step up compared to existing foldables, which typically use much lower-resolution sensors.\niPhone Fold’s hinge and materials\nThe hinge is another area where Apple may diverge from competitors. Multiple reports claim Apple will use Liquidmetal, which is a long-standing trade name for a metallic glass alloy the company has previously used in smaller components. While often referred to as “liquid metal” or “Liquid Metal” in reports, Liquidmetal is the branding Apple has historically associated with the material.\nLiquidmetal is said to be stronger and more resistant to deformation than titanium, while remaining relatively lightweight. If accurate, this could help improve long-term durability and reduce wear on the foldable display.\nLeaks from Jon Prosser also reference a metal plate beneath the display that works in tandem with the hinge to minimize creasing — a claim that aligns with reporting from Korean and Chinese supply-chain sources.\nBattery and other components \nBattery life is another potential differentiator. According to Ming-Chi Kuo and multiple Asian supply-chain reports, Apple is testing high-density battery cells in the 5,000 to 5,800mAh range.\nThat would make it the largest battery ever used in an iPhone, and competitive with (or larger than) batteries in current Android foldables. The device is also expected to use a future A-series chip and Apple’s in-house modem.\nPrice\nNone of this will come cheap, that’s for certain. Nearly every report agrees that the iPhone Fold will be Apple’s most expensive iPhone ever.\nEstimates currently place the price between $2,000 and $2,500 in the US. Bloomberg has said the price will be “at least $2,000,” while other analysts have narrowed the likely range to around $2,100 and $2,300. That positions the iPhone Fold well above the iPhone Pro Max and closer to Apple’s high-end Macs and iPads.\nDespite years of rumors, there’s still plenty that remains unclear. Apple hasn’t confirmed the name “iPhone Fold,” final dimensions, software features or how iOS would adapt to a folding form factor. Durability, repairability and long-term reliability are also open questions. For now, the safest assumption is that Apple is taking its time and that many of these details could still change before launch. \nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/iphone-fold-rumors-everything-we-know-so-far-including-the-leaked-foldable-design-upgrades-price-and-more-130000217.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Today, I’m talking with Roland Busch, who is the CEO of Siemens.\nSiemens is one of those absolutely giant, extremely important, but fairly opaque companies we love to dig into on Decoder. At a very basic, reductive level, Siemens makes the hardware and software that allow other companies to run and automate their stuff. Everyone has seen the Siemens logo somewhere, whether it’s under the hood of their cars, stamped on control systems in fancy buildings, or scattered across factory floors. But since it’s not really a consumer-facing company, it’s hard to know what ties all these ideas together — and what some 320,000 Siemens employees across the world are actually working on. \nHow all those people are organized and work together is wildly complicated. Roland and I spent some real time just talking through the Siemens corporate structure, which, for my true Decoderheads out there, was incredibly fascinating. \n\n\n\nVerge subscribers, don’t forget you get exclusive access to ad-free Decoder wherever you get your podcasts. Head here. Not a subscriber? You can sign up here. \nWe also spent a lot of time talking about automation broadly and what happens as AI brings automation from the physical world of factories into the digital world of accounting and procurement — the things that help decide what factories should be doing. Roland’s vision is for Siemens to automate the whole factory process, upstream and downstream of actually making things. And you’ll hear him describe that outcome as fairly utopian: a smooth, seamless, optimal operation. Very German. But I wanted to press him on how dystopian it sounds to me. Because in Roland’s vision, it seems like there’s a whole class of people who just… don’t have jobs anymore. And the ones who do have jobs don’t really have a whole lot of autonomy or fulfillment from them, but basically just serve as the hands for the all-seeing AI. So I asked him fairly directly about that.\nAnd if that’s not already all complicated enough: Siemens is a government and defense contractor on both sides of the Atlantic and a company whose overall growth is directly tied to free trade and globalization in the postwar era. A lot is going on right now that might challenge how the world works, especially if tensions keep rising between the US and Europe, and so I had to ask him point-blank: Do you think about what you’ll do if NATO collapses? Because that’s not as far-fetched a question as it used to be.\nThere’s a lot in this one, and Roland was game for it all. I think you’ll leave with a lot to think about — certainly more to think about whenever you see all those Siemens logos.\nOkay: Siemens CEO Roland Busch. Here we go.\n\n\nThis interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.\nRoland Busch, you are the president and CEO of Siemens. Welcome to Decoder.\nThank you, Nilay. Nice to meet you.\nIt’s nice to meet you as well. There’s a lot to talk about. Siemens is a huge company. It has a long history. You’ve been in a lot of businesses, you’ve been out of a lot of businesses. You have worked there since the ’90s. The world is very complicated right now, and Siemens is a very big, very complicated multinational operating in that world. I’m curious how you are thinking of all that.\nSo let me just start at the start: Siemens isn’t a consumer company. I think a lot of Decoder listeners have seen the logo, but maybe don’t understand the company. How would you describe Siemens today? What is the company?\nIndeed, it’s not that easy. We have come a long way. It’s been more than 170 years since the company was founded, and we made so many changes in our portfolio and in our company. Actually, when people talk about it, I say there’s one constant in our history, which is that we reinvented ourselves over and over again. And absolutely, we are now in the midst of another reinvention or transformation with one difference. This is the fastest and most fundamental one we ever had because of technology. And then people ask, “What is Siemens about? Because you now have Siemens Healthineers, you have Siemens Energy, you have Siemens?”\nAnd actually, it’s not that easy to describe. Siemens Healthineers has the task in its name. It’s about healthcare. Siemens Energy has the task in its name; it’s about energy. But Siemens is not that clear. So here is how I explain it. We transform, with our technology, every day for everyone. Okay, that doesn’t get you closer. But now, the point is that you have to look behind the curtain, and then you see what Siemens technology does.\nWhen you see a car passing by… Eventually, all cars will be touched by Siemens technology. It is either cars that are designed by our technology, or they are manufactured by it. Every third manufacturing line in the world is run by Siemens controls. If you walk through New York, you cannot walk a block without passing by a building that is automated by Siemens technology. I think we are controlling … I mean, something like a little bit less than 50 percent of electrons are touched by Siemens technologies in our distribution systems, low voltage systems. And if you talk about healthcare, if you get a scan somewhere in the world, the likelihood that it’s a Siemens CT or MR scan is a little bit shy of 50 percent. And this is what we do. We produce. We have technology which enables others to transform their everyday. And that is what Siemens is about.\nSo I listen to that, and I experience Siemens everywhere. I’m the person who pays attention to how a building is automated. I talk to a lot of car CEOs; I hear about Siemens as a supplier to the car industry quite a bit. It sounds like what you were describing basically is you operate things for people, or you build technologies or products that operate other things for people.\nThere are a lot of things in the world to operate. How do you organize the company? How do you think about where there’s opportunity and where there’s growth and investment, and then how do you think about your resources? Because it seems like we operate things for everyone. That’s a pretty wide remit that you could focus down in any number of ways.\nThis is an absolutely valid question because now we are active in so many different industries. It’s industries, manufacturing, process industries, but we are also in buildings, grids, and mobility. So people, trains, and signaling systems. The first basis of Siemens is — and this is where our value sits — in our technology platform, and in our design software. We have one of the largest software companies in the world. If it comes to industrial software, we are the largest. And with our software, you can build the most comprehensive physics-based digital twin of whatever product you do. And we are now expanding into molecules. So another one is automation technology, as talked about, or it can be for discrete process manufacturing. We also go for software-defined automation, which is kind of a disruption. Anything. We are the largest automation company. We are automating grids, we’re automating buildings, we’re automating signaling systems, we’re automating trains, and we are automating manufacturing. So the underlying technology is where the value is.\nNow, we are bringing this technology to different verticals, so markets. It’s the industrial markets, food and beverage, chemicals, automotive, machine builders, utilities, mobility operators, and the like. And then at this point, the domain know-how comes into play. So having technology is one thing, but having the domain know-how to deploy it, to talk customers’ language, is another one. And on top, quite obviously, is that the whole thing is now supercharged by AI technologies, which we are rolling in as we speak. We have a long history regarding AI. Actually, one of the first supercomputers to do machine learning algorithms was Synopsys. I mean, this was in the ’90s. Siemens had the most powerful one. This was the great-grandfather of the GPUs today.\nAnd since then, we have been working with artificial intelligence technologies, but this is now a new level that we want to bring it to. So the organization, obviously, we are organizing according to businesses. They are reflecting the markets we are acting in, but you have to look at it from the back, the underlying technology, including the data, which is super relevant.\nI’m very curious to talk to you about AI and automation. I think that’s very important. Digital twins, I’m curious about that. It seems like the future of automation is very rich. We’re moving from Siemens automating a lot of atoms, automating the physical world, to automating bits, and that’s a long conversation that I want to come to.\nI just want to stay focused on the company for one more turn here and ask the Decoder questions, because I feel like the structure of Siemens says a lot about the company itself. I was reading your last letter to shareholders. You were talking about how you’ve divested portfolio companies where you weren’t the best owner, you’re exiting some businesses, and you’re obviously investing in others. How is Siemens organized today? How is the company structured?\nWe run according to businesses. One is digital industries, which is all about the software, the automation piece. One is smart infrastructure. Here you’ll find our building technology, medium voltage, low voltage, but also the grid, grid automation, grid control, and grid soft control software. The third element is Siemens mobility, where we have our trains, high-speed locomotives, commuter, metro, light rail, but also rail infrastructure, including turnkey projects, which is part of that. And the last one, since we are still consolidating, is Siemens Healthineers, where we still hold some 70 percent. It is its own listed company, a DAX-listed company. We are about to let go. We announced a spinoff of 30 percent from 65-ish, but it’s a separate company. So that’s how we’re organized. Of course, we have our corporate organizations, like strategy. IT, we run horizontally. We have our M&A department, and I talked about our portfolio. So that’s what a corporation normally has.\nAnd maybe one more special thing is that we still have research. We still invest 8 percent of our revenue, so $6.5 billion, a portion of which goes into research advancements. We work on a quantum computer. We don’t build them, but we run on the software, the middleware, how to use it, and the applications. And we have also machine learning and KEI experts who are doing research there, like AI experts. So that’s roughly how the company runs. And then talking about regions, we have in total, including Healthineers, 320,000 people. We have 45,000 people sitting in the United States, 30,000 in China, 35,000 in India, and roughly 85,000 in Germany. It’s still a German company. There’s a lot of manufacturing here.\nThat’s a lot of people. \nIndeed.\nLet me ask you about that split between regions. I think a theme on Decoder recently, and you are a part of this trend, is that a lot of these companies are a lot bigger than people think. You described divisions, you described regions. Those are both potentially first-order organizations for companies, right? I talk to lots of CEOs, and regions are just the first-order organization. Other companies are divisions. You have both. How do those interact?\nYeah, I can tell you, this is a constant discussion because we have very strong regional leads. We have strong businesses. So this is a matrix, and every company has this matrix, and the first question is, which one is the predominant line? Is it the business or the regions? In our case, it’s a clear answer; it’s the businesses. So the businesses have the full P&L. Regions are, let’s say, the second derivative behind it. Still very strong. And we have, in some businesses, let’s take, for example, our low voltage business, switching technology, this business is fully run by regions. You have China, you have the United States, you have Europe, and this is their P&L. So roll it up by regions. If you talk about automation, the next level is still … It’s motion control for machine builders, it’s factory automation, it’s process automation, and then come the regions. Therefore, you still have a different kind of setup depending on the business on how we serve technologies.\nAnd then the third dimension, just to make it a little bit more complicated for you, is the verticals, because factory automation… Take factory automation, which is maybe the strongest automation business we have; they run into any kind of factory automation you can imagine. The discreet and hybrids, food and beverage, and automotive machines. Machine builders are by machine, control is another one, but then you have a lot of battery manufacturing, and you have semiconductors. Therefore, this is the third dimension to serve verticals, because each of them has a different language and different applications. So we are having a very, let’s say, three-dimensional matrix, but there’s a clear lead, and this is driven by the business lines.\nYeah. I ask everybody on Decoder how the businesses are structured. And the joke I always make is, if you tell me how the company is structured, I can tell you 80 percent of your problems. But in the case of Siemens, it seems like I’m still trying to figure it all out to even get to where the problems are. When you think about that organization, and you describe things like a common platform or shared innovation across these zones or the investments you need to make in AI, a lot of your competitors are new. They’re essentially functionally organized.\nYes.\nThere’s one person driving the business in the case of some of these startups. Siemens is very old. It’s organized divisionally, and then obviously, there are layers of organization between it. How do you think about investing in the core technologies, the core platforms in that structure? Because it seems like all of your divisions should be doing it, perhaps in redundant or repetitive ways.\nYeah, and you’re right. When I explain my organization, you can identify the problems or the opportunities, put it that way. And here comes the point. I talked about how we are investing $6.5 billion into R&D, and obviously, this goes into different businesses. And some of them have a higher share. This is 8 percent on average. Some of them are sitting on definitely more than 10 percent, 13 percent, 15 percent, some others are at 3 percent and 4 percent. So, capital allocation, is it R&D? Is it in CapEx, or also spending? That’s done business by business. Each of them has a business case, and we allocate capital. In some cases, we obviously want to allocate more capital in higher growth areas. And I talk about organic capital allocation if it comes to M&A. This is something that happens on the board. We come up with proposals, and we see where we want to spend more money and where we focus our M&A, and where we do not.\nBut then here comes the point, and this is the part of our ONE Tech company program. Actually, I started last year, together with my fellow board members, maybe one of the most fundamental transformations of our organizations, because you’re completely right, we are very much boxed. Below these businesses I talked about, like digital industries, we have software, and then we have automation. Automation is three boxes: factory automation, process automation, and motion control. Below that, we have even segments, so I just didn’t give you that complexity as well. We are very much boxed. And what we want to do is take layers out, so we bring that into bigger boxes. Actually, we are targeting six units. But then we also say we want to create fabrics, which is a kind of operating system where we have horizontal ones. So we have a data fabric, a technology fabric, and we have a sales fabric.\nSo the idea behind this fabric is it’s a thin layer, but it’s a very strong one where we are really scaling horizontally as much as we can. For sales fabric, for example, we want to use the same tools, the same nomenclature for customers. And believe it or not, if I ask today how much revenue we do with BMW, people have to run out and pile the numbers together. This stops now because we have one identifier for BMW, and with a push of a button, I know what to do. So they serve the same sales methodology. Also, the customer journeys should all be alike. Technology fabric is that we don’t do things over and over again. When we talk about a digital platform where we sell, we build it only once and sell our portfolio.\nSo this is a change. We are unboxing our organization in two little boxes. And the reason is… Number one is technology, and AI in particular doesn’t respect silos. AI doesn’t respect data silos, doesn’t respect any kind of boundaries. The world is squeezing out the small. You see that this is adding more and more, and the more data you have, the more capabilities you have, the stronger you are. It’s a fact. Look at the big companies. Therefore, we have to play to the strengths of Siemens, and this requires a different way of running this company. This is behind our ONE Tech company program, which is really pulling in horizontally as much as we can, yet respecting different go-to-markets and different kinds of technologies or applications of technologies, depending on the verticals we are serving. So, not losing our strengths, which we have built over so many years, while scaling horizontally. Does it make sense?\nIt does. I’ve never been so excited to talk about structure with anyone as I have been with you, because that seems very hard. Well, it seems like what you’re describing to me is a multi-hundred-year-old company that has traditionally been very divisional, trying to get to some functional structures so that you can move faster. And that traditionally has come with culture cost, it has come with disruption inside the company, it’s come with inertia. How are you dealing with that at a company the size of Siemens? There are 320,000 people. They can’t all be happy with you.\nIt’s hard. It’s hard. So where do you start? Give a little bit of insight into how we did in the past and how we do it right now with our ONE Tech company program. In the past, we had many restructurings and many changes. The point was a managing board, these are typically something, but we have now seven people, and we used to have 15 or more, whatever. In the past, these guys were going together with their strategies in a room, defining a new structure, laying out a new org chart, and then, “Dear colleagues, this is where we want to go, and we reshuffle.” Okay. You can imagine how that goes down. This time, we created a north star where we want to be. The north star is basically what I sketched to you, these fabrics, the businesses, but allow them to focus on what they need to do, focus on their customers, on their applications, but yet we want to get horizontals into it.\nAnd then we said, “This is a north star and here are, we call it tracks, the tracks to the north star. These are the points where we really want to touch.” For example, our CRM system for automation was completely scattered. We want to do that, and this is a blueprint for the whole company, which can go on and on. And then we engaged people to say, “Let’s go,, and you work with us now on these tracks and how to change it.” That means we give the people an opportunity to contribute, to bring their ideas, but we have a clear idea of where we want to go in order to move first. Secondly, you obviously need to communicate a lot. You have to explain what you do because you’re describing something where people don’t know where it goes; they’re not experienced to work that way. But you have to talk about it over and over again, explain why we do it, what the benefits are, and what changes for the people.\nAnd for some, they said, “I don’t experience any change.” “Yes, because we don’t touch everything. We touch only things where you really can improve.” And some we just let go, because why would you fix something that’s not broken? The next one is that we train our people, because transformation is not just shifting boxes; it’s a different set of values. Collaboration is a much, much more important element in it. So we are putting a lot of emphasis on helping them also. And change is not only a structure, but it’s also the processes behind the way you lead. And the last thing is, obviously, you also want to inject capabilities from the outside, on a higher level, where you have people who know what good looks like when it comes to a super professional sales organization, when it comes to AI technologies and more developing models, and this helps a lot.\nAnd then we do that all over the company, on the lower level, and the higher level. But if you talk to a really high-level person, if you come with people who really have the gravitas, who bring the experience where nobody would doubt that if they say, “This is how modern software looks like,” they have authority themselves without giving them the stars and stripes. They just put people together and say, “This is how we go.” And people listen and follow. So this is the package, and you need all of them, all of them, in order to make this transformation.\nAnd I can say it seems to work. I had a huge respect for it. I’m a lifetimer at Siemens, and I saw in my 30 years so many changes and programs. And before pulling the trigger for this big change, which is the deepest one for the last at least 20 years, you think about it twice, because if this vessel runs in the wrong direction, you have a problem. And we have to deliver at the same time. But I pulled the trigger because I knew that we had to change. The environment of technology is changing so fast, so we have to be at the forefront, but I’m quite happy because it has been running for one year and is making good progress. There’s another one ahead of us. By the end of the fiscal year…  So by the end of this, by October, November, we are basically through with all the big moves and the changes, and we are already grooving in the first batch of changes we made. Sales seem to work quite well. We are grooving in. And then within two years, I would say we are ready to scale.\nLet me ask you the other Decoder question I ask everybody. This is a big decision. How do you make decisions? What’s your framework for making decisions?\nThe first thing about decisions is empowerment. Don’t pull every decision up to the boardroom. It makes us slow. It is really not attracting people. People want to really make decisions on a lower level. So basic ideas, deciding on the lowest possible level. However, empowerment is not anarchy. If you have a clear strategy with those set boundaries, this is where I want to go. Within that frame, within your responsibility, you can act and are empowered. Empowered is a two-way street as well. Empowerment gives freedom, but it also requires accountability. So if you empower somebody, they have to be accountable for what the people are doing, which is super important. This is the first thing. So don’t decide on things that you can decide on a lower level.\nBut then, if it comes to, let’s say, the bigger rocks, the M&A decisions, this really goes into a very … I mean, we have processes, how we do it. We had a “P” proposal, which is a proposal where somebody says, “This is a company I want to acquire. This is my business case.” Outside in, in order to say, “Okay, now we believe in that.” You give your trigger, you already know how to negotiate, go forward, and make a non-binding offer. And then they work on it. We have a lot of processes, and when it comes up, we call it an “I” proposal where we finally pull the trigger to say, “Now you can invest, and you can go.”\nAnd the decisions are, when it comes to strategies, engaging as many people as we can, the experts, listening to them in the boardroom. In some cases, we also ask them not to prepare a super-polished PowerPoint. That’s not the point. We want to really get the content. And then we have a very open discussion culture in our management board with our leaders to make better decisions. Very often, I’m also snorkeling around. We are getting advice from others, pulling our network if it comes to certain decisions. But I would say it’s a structured process, but it’s a process which encourages people to speak up, to bring their opinion in order to come to better decisions.\nLet me ask one more question here, then I want to talk about the state of the world, and I really do want to talk about how you see AI and digital twins fitting into automation, because there’s a lot there.\nLet’s say I’m a Siemens engineer working on low voltage switch gear. I’m one of 35,000 people in India, and I’m like, the CEO’s at CES talking about fabrics with [Nvidia CEO] Jensen Huang on stage, and we’re in the middle of a two-year transformation … But I just need to get my work done, and this is all just some corporate strategy distraction. How do you bring those two things together? Because this is the thing that kills projects at big companies. It kills them dead. And the number of times I’ve heard that story is very high. So how do you bring that together?\nI know. There’s the first one, and this is so super important for communication because, and you got it right, low voltage. This is as mechanical as it can get. This is mechanical stuff, so it’s no software, no KEI, if not in the development, of course. But normally, this is a product that is hardware. Not only because we have now solid state switching, which is disruptive, which brings software into it, but take that aside. And then talking about being on stage, talking about KEI, new models, and digital twins, the people sometimes feel lost. Push is always talking about that stuff, but I’m just doing mechanicals. So we have to give love to these guys as well because they do a lot in terms of contributing to top and bottom line cash flow to our company. They are part of the equation.\nIf you go to any kind of customer, they say, “I love your automation. I love your software, but still I have to do some switching here,” and we are rolling in. And it’s super relevant because if you don’t have a switch or if it breaks, then you have a problem. So they bring the capabilities to a customer and say — we also have some low voltage here — but really say, “This is important for you to have a very solid operation.” It makes sense, and they are proud to contribute. So you have to distribute your love not only to the new stuff, but also to those that are basically super important and carry our P&L forward. And then the other element is, believe it or not, this CES presentation or keynote where you really are on par with … I mean, Jensen’s there, Satya [Nadella, Microsoft CEO] is there, and you show what we do and people … Even the low voltage guys are proud of what we do.\nI’ll give a last one because I have to share it with you. We didn’t talk about a completely different area, which is mobility, Siemens Mobility. They do trains. This is hard stuff, boogies, frames, mechanical. These trains are super loaded with automation. These are basically software-defined trains because they tell you whatever … Even before they come to the depot, they tell the depot what they need, which part, what’s wrong, and how to replace it. So it’s technology at its best. However, which company can say that we are transforming the whole economy of 110 million people in a country, which is Egypt? It’s where we built 2,000 kilometers of railway lines from the north to the south, west to the east, connecting 90 million people and transforming the whole system with high-speed commuters and locomotives. This makes people proud, and I didn’t mention any AI technology, even though it’s in our trains, but this is something where we could say, “Who? Which and who? Which company in the world can do that?”\nI’m very curious about all of that. I think there’s some amount of, you said, software-defined low voltage switches or software on the trains. Those worlds are colliding. I want to ask broadly just about the landscape you’re operating in to do all of that work. These are big opportunities at work. If you want to sell trains, you need to be a global company. You can’t be a single country train supplier. You have to operate everywhere.\nI look at Siemens and its size and its history, and I say, “Okay, this company took advantage of globalization and free trade.” You’re in all these countries around the world, you’ve got tens of thousands of people all over the place, you’re building products all over the place, you’re taking advantage of the opportunities and the markets you’re in, the talent that’s in those markets.\nAnd then I look up, and I read the newspaper, and the walls are going up around the world, everywhere, every single day. The Trump administration seems intent on putting ever-higher walls between the US and Europe, in particular, which seems very confusing to me. Other countries are nationalists in other ways. How are you thinking about Siemens in that moment, where a company that was able to grow and be such a large provider to so many people because of free trade and globalization, now has to contend with ever-higher walls and barriers between countries?\nObviously, we believe in free trade more than trade barriers because it brought the world to where we are, and leveraging all technology as fast as possible means bringing it to different countries as fast as possible. The good news about it is, and I mentioned our footprint before, since we are global from the very beginning… By the way, when Werner von Siemens founded this company 175 years or more ago, he sent one brother to London and one to Russia because he knew Germany was too small for his technology to scale. Ever since, Siemens has been a global company. And now our local for local content in the United States or China is 85 percent, 87 percent. So that means we are so local, and we have goods traveling from different places. So the impact on tariffs currently, and we said it last year, it’s a public figure, in 2025 last fiscal year was a low, mid-single-digit bottom-line impact.\nOkay, that’s good for us. It’s maybe not good for others. Our customers are suffering, and with our customers, we are suffering, obviously. We know that machine builders have a reduced volume because their machines are tariffed when they go to the United States. Along with that, normally comes a Siemens Automation, so we see that, but the direct impact is rather low. It’s a second impact. And we are increasing our resilience as we speak. As it comes to certain semiconductors, we are trying to double source as much as possible, which we didn’t do before, in order to scale. We are looking for more localization to invest in the United States. We doubled our capacity for low voltage, medium voltage switching. We invested in assembly lines for trains. Investing in the United States. We are investing in India and China because that is one of our largest markets. Therefore, the good news is that we are quite resilient. Bad news is that for many, many of our customers, it doesn’t help, and it somehow slows down.\nWhen you talk about investing in manufacturing in the United States, I’ve watched a lot of companies say a lot of things about investing in manufacturing in the United States. I’m from Racine, Wisconsin. I watched Foxconn insist that it was going to build an LCD factory in Racine, Wisconsin, and then simply not do that. And I watched Tim Cook reopen a factory that was already making Macs, so Donald Trump, in his first term, could say that Apple was opening a factory. There is a lot of theater about manufacturing in the United States, and then there’s the reality of investing for the long term when presidents come and go. How are you balancing that? Is it theater? Is it real investment? What is the split?\nSo the truth is, it’s a little bit of both. Where it’s real, let’s talk about the pharmaceutical industry. This is real investment. The Swiss ones, the German ones, are investing in pharmaceutical production in the United States. Some car makers that are not that strong, do that. But the big wave of remanufacturing in the United States is not happening yet. We don’t see that. And the reason is, maybe you mentioned it, number one, is the availability of people, also trained people. It is that you don’t know yet where the whole tariff situation will settle at the end of the day. The other reason is, why are we in a world that looks this way? It’s because American companies, in particular, were basically leveraging low labor costs and low costs in other countries, and they made a good living out of it. And you mentioned some of them as well. So do I believe that this will change? Yes. I believe there will be a wave, and we do see more manufacturing coming.\nAnd I didn’t mention semiconductors. Definitely, this is a hard fact. Semiconductor builds. Maybe even battery factories would come, pharmaceuticals, and the like. The only point I always advise our customers is that if you build a new manufacturing line in the United States, make it as automated and as digital as possible for obvious reasons, because you cannot get enough labor, let alone trained labor. And technology is there. So if you go there with a greenfield planned, you have all the freedoms to make this whole thing digital before even sending the first excavation machine. Your products, digitalizing your manufacturing, simulate everything. That’s what we do, by the way. Whenever we build a new one, we go all in. And then you build it. It’s faster. You don’t make mistakes in building. It increases your space productivity and reduces your energy consumption. It increases your output while having more variables and more variants of your products. So that will come, but we thought it would come faster; it seems there’s a delay in really ramping up manufacturing in the United States. And again, maybe sector by sector, you’ll see different patterns.\nDo you think that’s because people assume that there will be a snap back to normal trade relations in the world, or do you think it’s just slow?\nThe latter one. I don’t believe these tariffs will just snap back. Why? Tariffs, more or less, are like taxes, and they help close the budget deficit. And I never saw taxes going back. I hope that this may come to more normal terms. For example, our machines, which are exported to the United States, suffer from tariffs, but they also face these tariffs on aluminum and steel on top of that, which makes them quite expensive. So maybe that goes away. There might be some adoptions, which I think will come, but I don’t believe that this goes back to where we came from.\nLook, I have a rudimentary understanding of economics.\nYou are doing well.\nI studied this as an undergraduate at the University of Chicago 20 years ago. My understanding of all this is that this is how you equalize labor rates. You say, “Okay, you can make the products cheaper overseas. We’ll just put a tariff on top of it. Now the product is as expensive as making it in the United States, so you might as well make it here.” And that is bluntly what the Trump administration is haphazardly trying to convey. But what you’re saying is, “We’re Siemens. We make automation. We can virtually model the entire factory as a digital twin before you build it. In AI, we can automate even more. We can automate people using Excel to program your factory. Just build that.” And I look at that, and I say, “Well, that didn’t get anybody a job.” I look at data center investment in the United States, and communities around the United States are pushing back on data centers because they’re like, “This is a lot to extract from the environment and from our land, and not enough jobs.” And I see that same argument being applied to fully automated factories.\nYes.\nHow do you push back against that? Is a fully automated factory a net addition to the economy, do you think?\nIt’s a net-add with fewer people per output, if you don’t automate. Absolutely. That’s absolutely clear. The point is, we are living in aging societies. Germany, Japan, Korea, and China are aging. There’s a really steep curve. So sooner or later, you will see that creating jobs like crazy is maybe not the point because you’re missing jobs anyhow, or labor anyhow. You might want to deploy the labor you have in jobs that you cannot replace. The social system, the healthcare system, and the like, use labor really where it makes a difference. And in manufacturing, you have less and less. This is changing. You still have people on our shop floor, but you will have fewer. And you said it right, an AI factory fully automated, this uses a lot of space, uses a lot of energy, and it creates a limited number of jobs. That’s what an AI factory is. Yeah.\nWho buys the outputs of an AI factory?\nThe tokens. Intelligence.\nI’m just saying, if I build a fully automated factory to make cars, but no one has a job, who buys the cars?\nAgain, as I said before, what you do when you have full auto manufacturing, you’re driving the economy, you grow faster. You can bring the production to the United States, which has value in it. And once the economy is growing, obviously, your GDP per capita is increasing, and people are going to buy cars, but they have a different deployment.\nBut where do they get the money? Again, a rudimentary understanding of economics.\nSo number one is you’re replacing blue collar workers with more trained workers, with engineers, maybe also blue collar workers using AI technology. So a factory doesn’t run without… Again, we have higher output with fewer people, but you still have … I mean, I talked about it, the whole service sector is super relevant, and they’re missing people as well. Germany, for example, I can share about that. If we do not have hundreds of thousands of immigrants, and most of them working in service jobs, including hospitals and the like… If I take them out of the equation, our whole healthcare system would collapse. So there are a lot of jobs that you cannot replace. And that’s one more thing. When people ask me what to study, I say, “Okay, a solid education in mathematics or physics is always good, but if you don’t really feel like it, you can go for a plumbing job or a handicraft job, because that is the last job to be replaced.”\nYeah. The world needs electricians and plumbers for sure. That much I understand. Someone’s got to build and plumb the data centers, and maybe that’s the only career in the future. So your vision is like a fully automated factory. You’re talking about the higher-order jobs, like information jobs, technology jobs, and engineering jobs. I would call those software jobs. In some broad categorization, there’s some amount of white-collar work that has a laptop involved. That’s the next thing you could automate with AI. And you’ve made some gestures at that, right? We can automate even more of the things.\nYeah.\nAs I mentioned earlier, it seems like a lot of the frame for how you’re thinking is, Siemens has traditionally automated atoms, now you can automate bits.\nYes.\nAnd I see so much excitement about AI automating bits. How are you thinking about that, moving up from, okay, you’ve decided how many units to produce, we’ll produce them, to we’re going to actually automate the deciding of how many units to produce?\nAnd this goes really deep because… And this is when we talk about this industrial operating system, an AI-based operating system, where you really talk about this manufacturing line, which is finally … Running autonomously is a big word, but we are getting closer and closer to doing that. And here comes the point. Number one, it obviously starts with — and I’ll come to manufacturing in a second — but it starts with the design of your product. You create a digital twin of your product, and you simulate how it runs on a manufacturing line. And this loop of producing and simulating and producing your products, which you already have in the digital world, is so powerful. Because whenever you make a change, a component, maybe you want to be more resilient when designing another component, you go all the way back to your design drawings, you change it, and you know which part of manufacturing is impacted. So that’s very powerful.\nBut let me speak on the manufacturing line itself. The whole idea is that you start building this operating system, which is a layered system. Obviously, you need to get all the data that your manufacturing line produces. You have to connect to all your machines, the status of your machines, enrich them with environmental data, as you want to get the real-time data, even the drawing data of your machines as well, because once you have that, and you simulate it … And this is what we call the digital twin composer. That means you’re sucking in different digital twins of a machine, of a line, of a product; you suck it in, and then you have a complete, comprehensive digital twin which ingests real-time data. Then you can go forward and backward in time, and you can find out what the problem is.\nAnd then here comes the real one, when you close the loop of ingesting data but sending data back to the line, which is then the agent, which behaves on behalf of you. An agent is like a trained supervisor for a line. So when a red light is blinking, a supervisor goes there, looks at it, and says, “Oh yeah, this is a problem. I know that, over and over again, this is what I have to do.” And this is what AI agents can do. Finally, you still need somebody who is removing a blockage, changing, or updating. Maybe updating the software will be automatic, but changing a part, changing a piece, or having a switch where something is going wrong, you need people who know what to do. We tell them what to do with glasses. I also presented it at CES.\nSo this helps you interact in your natural words and helps you fix things, even if you don’t know all the details. This is where agents come in, or orchestration agents, which are supported by a machine building agent, a machine agent, a product agent, a workflow agent, whatever. And that’s how the future looks, which is very powerful. It keeps your yield high, your quality process very high, and you’re super agile if there’s any change or change in your production because you have a different version you want to produce. It’s super smart, and it doesn’t take a week to reassemble your line, but it really goes automatically.\nWhen you talk about industrial agents… So there are some lines, something’s gone wrong, a warning light goes off, and you say an agent will help you figure out what’s wrong and potentially fix it by itself. Is that based on an LLM? Are you using one of the models from one of the big companies, and it’s just an LLM that you’ve trained to think about a line in that way?\nYep, but not only that. It’s based on an LLM, different ones, depending on which one we are working on and different use cases, but it’s based on an LLM, but it’s not good enough. If you only use an LLM or an LLM-based agent to fix a problem, the hit rate is near what we need, but we are training these LLMs on our data, on proprietary data, product data, machine data, and operation data. Once you have that, and even the data of fixes in the past … Remember, when you’d walk a [manufacturing] plant, and you’d see the whiteboard where a supervisor writes, “I have a problem here, this is who is working on it, and here I fixed it.” All that knowledge goes into this model so that you just say, “Okay, this is the pattern of a problem. This is what the fix was.” The model knows it because we upload the data.\nSo it’s a model that is trained. This is why we talk about an industrial AI model, which is trained on industrial data. Fundamental, if it really runs across, but also very specific, if it comes to certain machines, then the hit rate goes up from 60 percent, 70 percent, to the 95-ish/8-ish plus, which is really what you can do then.\nAre these your models that you’re training, or are you augmenting models you’re taking?\nWe are augmenting. We don’t do LLMs, so really large models that are trained on the whole of knowledge in the world. This we don’t do [in house]. This is what we’re using any kind of, for specific tasks. We have some models which are very good in software, copilots, and agents for software. And now we are working on really genuine and new product designs, not only just having the next code line, but really genuine designs, a completely different world. And in some cases, we’re working on copilots on the shop floor. We talk about Microsoft, for example, and we are having the first use cases doing that. So, challenges, of course, are that an industrial AI application doesn’t accept hallucination. You really have to be sure that once you send an agent out, it does what you want it to do.\nThis is my fundamental question, and I’ve asked a lot of people this. I’m very curious about your perspective, because the domain is so different. I am not convinced that LLM technology, as it exists today, can make the leap to do all of the things that people want it to do. You see the gaps. Even as you’re saying, an LLM on its own hallucinates enough to only be effective 60 percent to 70 percent of the time. That’s nowhere near good enough for all of the things people want it to do — especially at the labor replacement rates that some of these folks talk about. Do you think it’s good enough, or do you think it’s the actual augmentation that makes it, the products that you build with it, good?\nThey need the augmentation, absolutely.\nAnd actually, I’m also going to ask the second part of that question. Do you see LLM technology, the core technology, improving at a rate that might change your assessment of it?\nGood point. To the question, LLMs will get better and better, but I don’t believe that these LLMs, if you do not train them really on specific industrial data, and this is where the augmentation comes from… You can train them as well, and as long as we want, but they will not get to the level that we can use on the shop floor. It will not work. I strongly believe that the LLMs need specific, domain-specific, machine-specific data in order to really make a difference. But then, if you do that, then you really can make a step up, which is fundamentally higher. I can give you two examples, which are maybe interesting. One is an optical inspection task where we used an LLM and said, “Okay, show me the problem.” Hit rate was okay-ish, but not to the level we needed. Then we start training the model with not so much data, which is anyhow important because if you’re manufacturing at a PPM level, guess how many mistakes you get a day? But on those that you have made, you then create some synthetic data around those.\nOnce you train the model, your hit rate goes up substantially. It’s much, much higher than if you use the next best and next best models. Is there convergence? To some extent, I do believe there’s a certain ceiling where you can train as well as you want, but if you do not get specific training, then you have a problem. Now, my second example is, and now I will give you a little bit of the spirit of how deep you have to go… We have an Italian manufacturer, they make robots, a crib in the box, a crib in the box for any kind of parts. And obviously, you can train a robot to make this crib in a box. What we did was create this wholly in the digital world. We used a digital part with a digital arm, digital software, a digital camera, and maybe everything, and we trained a robot over and over again on this crib in the box with our technology. And then we switched it on, and the hit rate was still not satisfying, 70-odd level.\nIt’s amazing now because we trained for hundreds of hours virtually. Then we used Nvidia technology with a photorealistic ray tracing of these pieces, photorealistic ray tracing at different lights, and trained the model over again. The hit rate was jumping up substantially. So these little details of having a normal representation of a digital part and a really photorealistic one made the hit rate come up substantially. And this is also the reason why when you train robots now in the virtual world, it doesn’t really work. There’s a reason we have so many people who are standing there with some handles and training robots to do a job and train over and over and over again, because this is real training on the real stuff. And these little details make a difference between an industrial application and one that you cannot use. What I’m saying is that training models on specific data, on valuable design data, operation data, and time series data, brings them to the level that we need in order to deploy them.\nAll that data has to come from lots of different customers, and you talk about Siemens as having all that data. But that data actually belongs to your customers. Are they willing to let you aggregate so that you can develop the products at the scale that you’re talking about?\nSo don’t underestimate the amount of data we have. I talk about generations of design data for controls, for trains, for switches, and whatnot, number one. Number two is that we have, I don’t know, how many thousands of machines we are operating. We have machines, we have machine jobs, machining jobs. But if we then go to my AI guys, they say, “Okay, you make everything available now from Siemens?” Then they say, “Ah, still not enough.” They need so much data to train models. Now we have an alliance for machine builders, German machine builders, nine of them. I mean top, top, top. These are the names, Trumpf, DMG Mori, and the like; they are ready now to share their data with us to train models, to bring them a model that they can use to make an application that makes their machines run autonomously.\nSo you just say, “This is the part, here’s the machine, and just get going.” They know that their data is not very useful because it’s too little, but if you add up, if you create these data alliances, it works. It requires a certain trust. This is again where Siemens comes in because they trust us. We have been partners for decades now. We are very mindful of that one. So you’re right, you need as much data as possible. You need as much proprietary data as possible. Would they share the data of their absolute latest machine with us? No, but don’t need that. It can use all the other ones, which is absolutely helpful.\nLet me wrap up with just a big picture question here. I’m just thinking about Siemens as a company and what it represents, and all the places it is around the world, and the value of this scale. You have 320,000 people in all the places around the world. And then I just think about the barriers going up. And Siemens is a defense contractor for both the United States government and Europe, and a bunch of other countries around the world. Are you planning for an event as catastrophic as the dissolution of NATO? It’s great to be like, we can aggregate all the data from all our customers, but also the world might fall apart. Are you thinking about Siemens as a global company in that context?\nYes, we do. If you ask me, do we make a kind of scenario planning of another war or whatever, some incident in Taiwan, we don’t really, because I told my people we cannot do that over and over again. It comes in different forms. So, therefore, why would you? Stay agile and be really fast if something happens. So this is one thing. On the other side, we see obviously the trends in the world, and we are working more and more on what we call the forging of technologies. So, local for local, that you do not always rely on certain technologies from the United States used in China for China and the United States, or for Europe. So it’s a pity because normally you would like to scale, and we still have core technologies which we can multiply, but obviously, getting … For example, we are training our industrial AI applications for China on Chinese LLMs, whereas for the United States, obviously, we train them on American hyperscalers or whatever, LLMs.\nSo we have good experiences also, and this makes us more resilient. Can I do that for everything? Can I fork all my software? I could, but it’s just prohibitively expensive; it doesn’t make sense. But for certain areas, we do that and increase our resilience and hope for the best.\nI realize I’m ending on a down note here, but it just seems like so much of what you’re excited about is the opportunity of scale, the opportunity to do these things cooperatively, in a way that maybe changes the world economy, and all of us are just caring for robots in the end. But these are huge global ideas that you have, and I’m just trying to put them in the context of, boy, when I hear other people talk about AI, it is in the context of national champions and international competition in a way that feels very old. \nIt does not feel like the world of the past 20 years. This feels like a return to a different time. And I’m just wondering how you can keep the optimism of the scale and the globalization when that is happening all around you.\nMaybe I have this optimism because I’m working in one of the most international companies in the world. We are a Chinese company, as we are a United States company and a European one, and we have so many great people all around the world. And I’ll also see how they are collaborating, and I believe that this is a core value of societies, which is super, super relevant for the future. There might be times where this is not appreciated so much for whatever reason, but in the long run, I believe that a world which is using technologies in order to solve the real problems in the world … We have to feed 10 billion people now. We are creating our climate and whatnot. And we have aging societies where healthcare is a huge problem. So we cannot solve it if we box ourselves too small, so scale it. And here I hope that when we have waves of opening and closing and whatnot, that ultimately this pays out if you are acting in a global international network as we do, and therefore I’m more optimistic.\nWhat should we be looking for next from Siemens?\nI think the next thing is that we are walking the talk. We talk about that we are building this industrial AI operating system, that we are using AI now for the next level to really not only validate, but also create, that we are leveraging our capabilities of bringing the real world and the digital world together, because the digital world can do so much if you do not have an impact on the real world. We show that with our customers, like PepsiCo, which was showing at CES, like Kyron, the supply chain or logistics company, or many, many others. And to see that we can be the entry door for AI technology into the real world together with our partners at scale.\nRoland, this has been great. I could do another full hour just on the structure of Siemens. I think, as you can tell.\nI know. I know.\nYou’re going to have to come back.

You’ll get no shame from me if you love your phone and have a healthy relationship with your apps, but I’ve found myself struggling lately.\nThis year, I’m attempting to cut back on screen time – sort of. I’m replacing the sleek oblong of my smartphone with something a little more fuzzy and nostalgic. In an attempt to dismantle my bad habit, I’m closing the feeds of instant updates and instead carrying around a Game Boy Advance. I’ve been playing Pokémon FireRed, a remake of the very first Pokémon games, which turn 30 this month. Even this refreshed version is more than two decades old.\n Continue reading...",

In a post on X, Musk claims the company could complete this in less than 10 years, while doing the same on Mars would take over 20 years.\nThis marks a major shift for the aerospace company, as Musk points out that the logistics of first completing a proof of concept on the moon are easier with respect to launch windows and proximity to Earth. The SpaceX founder is notorious for promising optimistic timelines that never come to pass, and said in 2017 that a base on Mars would be ready for its first settlers as early as 2024.\n\nIn subsequent replies to other posts Musk predicted \"Mars will start in 5 or 6 years, so will be done parallel with the Moon, but the Moon will be the initial focus.\" He also said a manned Mars flight might happen in 2031.\nEarly last year Musk said in a post on X that SpaceX would be going \"straight to Mars\" and that \"the Moon is a distraction.\" This was in response to Space industry analyst Peter Hague pointing out that among other considerations, lunar regolith, a material found on the surface of the moon, is about 45 percent oxygen. In 2023 NASA proved this oxygen could be extracted, which would yield enormous payload savings as opposed to shipping liquid oxygen between Earth and Mars.\nNASA's Artemis missions, which SpaceX is a contractor for at certain stages, are planned to see humans back on the lunar surface by 2028. Artemis II, during which astronauts will circle the moon before returning to Earth, is set to launch in March of this year.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/space/spacex-is-pivoting-to-focus-on-a-moon-base-before-mars-141851264.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Discord is the latest company looking to bolster its child safety (again). Starting in March, all users will have a \"teen-appropriate experience\" by default. Unlocking adult content and age-gated spaces will require a (usually one-time) verification process.\nThe platform's big safety update encompasses communication settings, restricted access to age-gated spaces and content filtering. Users who aren't verified as adults will see blurred sensitive content. In addition, age-restricted channels, servers and app commands will be blocked. DMs and friend requests from unknown users will be routed to a separate inbox.\nIf you're an adult, removing these restrictions will require one of two verification methods at launch. You can take a selfie video for age estimation or submit a government ID to Discord's vendor partners. (Let's just hope the age estimations work better than Roblox's.) The company stresses that the video selfies you submit for age estimation never leave your device. And it claims ID documents sent to its vendor partners are deleted quickly, \"in most cases, immediately after age confirmation.\"\nAlthough Discord says the process will be one-and-done for most people, some may be required to submit multiple forms of verification. It also says that additional verification options will arrive in the future, including an age inference model that runs in the background.\nThis isn’t the company’s first attempt at beefing up its child safety measures. In 2023, it banned teen dating channels and AI-generated CSAM. Later that year, it added content filters and automated warnings. Those changes followed an NBC News report that 35 adults had been prosecuted on charges of \"kidnapping, grooming or sexual assault\" that involved Discord communication.\nAlongside today’s changes, Discord is recruiting for a new Teen Council. The group will include 10 to 12 teens aged 13 to 17. The company says this \"will help ensure Discord understands — not assumes — what teens need, how they build meaningful connections, and what makes them feel safe and supported online.\" This sounds like the corporate equivalent of the parenting advice: “Don’t just talk to your children; listen to them, too.”\nThe child safety changes will start rolling out globally in early March. Both new and existing users will be required to submit verification for adult content.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/discord-will-soon-require-age-verification-to-access-adult-content-140000218.html?src=rss",

    "source": "Engadget is a web magazine with obsessive daily coverage of everything new in gadgets and consumer electronics",
    "summary": "Since Apple finally put its mysterious and long-suffering Project Titan out to pasture, we've wondered what a Jony Ive-designed Apple Car might have looked like. Today, we might have a clue. This, though, is no Apple Car. It's the Ferrari Luce (\"light\" in Italian), the actual name for the EV formerly known as Elettrica, and I'm fresh from getting a walkthrough of the thing from Sir Ive himself. At a glance things look like you might have expected, but there are a few surprises here.\nWhile Ferrari has sold hybrids in some form or another since 2013's LaFerrari, Luce (née Elettrica) will be the company's first all-electric machine. We got our first look underneath back in October, when we saw the chassis, battery pack and other details that pointed to this being a larger, more family-friendly machine than your average Ferrari. Last week, I got a look at the next major component, the interior, which comes courtesy of LoveFrom.\nLoveFrom is the house that Jony Ive founded after leaving Apple in 2019. The obsessive design firm, which currently numbers about 60 employees, was acquired by OpenAI for $6.5 billion last year. LoveFrom has thus far taken on a medley of projects, like the $60,000 Linn Sondek LP12 turntable, but the Luce could be among the company's biggest projects so far — at least in terms of literal dimensions.\nIf you're familiar with the designs that Apple produced under Ive's tenure, particularly in the era beginning with the iPhone 4, you'll feel right at home here. The overall aesthetic is one dominated by squircles and circles, all with absolute, minute perfection and symmetry. \nFerrari Luce interior designed by LoveFrom\nFerrari\n\nAt first blush, it's a bit clinical, but dig deeper, start poking and prodding, and you'll see there's a real sense of charm here. Fun little details and genuinely satisfying tactility begin to reveal themselves. The key, for example, has a yellow panel with an E Ink background. Push the key into the magnetized receiver in the center console, and the yellow on the key dims, moving across to glow through the top of the glass shifter. It’s meant to symbolize a sort of transference of life.\nThe shifter isn't the only thing that's glass. There are 40-odd pieces of Corning Gorilla Glass scattered throughout the cockpit, everything from the shifter surround to the slightly convex lenses in the gauge cluster. What isn't glass is aluminum, much of it anodized in your choice of three colors: gray, dark gray and rose gold. \nYes, all that sure does sound like I'm writing about a new iPhone and not the latest Ferrari. But where Apple has been pruning every physical control it possibly can from its devices lately, LoveFrom will insert some great tactility in the Luce. The shifter moves through its detents satisfyingly, the air vents open and close with a clear snick and the paddles behind the steering wheel pop with a great feel.\nMy favorite feature is the windshield wiper control, a little dial in the upper-right of the steering wheel face. It features a tiny lens that magnifies the current setting. It's actually magnifying one of four custom OLED panels, 200 ppi units from Samsung, cut and shaped to deliver LoveFrom's ornate style. \nFerrari Luce interior designed by LoveFrom\n\nThe gauge cluster behind the steering wheel, or binnacle as it's more formally called here, is two OLED displays stacked on top of each other, with a physical needle sandwiched between serving as a pseudo-tachometer for this car without an engine. The gauges change and morph as you move from one mode to the next. \nThe center display is a 10.12-inch OLED perforated with plenty of holes to allow some pleasingly chunky toggle switches through, plus a glass volume knob. The little clock in the upper-right can turn into a stopwatch or a compass, with its needles swinging about depending on the mode. The whole central control panel pivots and swivels. Just grab the big handle below and drag it where you want it. \nThe attention to detail on everything is astonishing. Even the rails that hold the seats to the floor are gently shaped and anodized to match the rest of the interior. \nIve was on hand to unveil the interior, clearly a little nervous about showing all this for the first time. After five years of working confidentially on this topic, Ive said he was \"enormously excited\" and \"completely terrified\" to provide our first real glimpse at the Luce. \nMarc Newson, who founded LoveFrom with Ive, said: \"Jony and I share a really, really deep interest in automotive things and vehicles. Actually, I'd go so far as to say that that is probably a hobby of both of ours.\"\nBoth Ive and Newson own many vintage machines, and Ive said that modern cars \"are missing some things that we love about our old Ferraris.\" Things like tactility. \"It was very clear to us that we needed to figure out as many ways as possible to viscerally and physically connect to the interface,\" Ive said.\nFerrari Luce interior designed by LoveFrom\n\nSo, while the Luce does have that pivoting touchscreen, it's far from the vehicle's primary interface. Ive said he hopes that physical connection and all the clever touches create a uniquely charming vehicle. \nIve told me that the LoveFrom team has genuinely enjoyed working with Ferrari. \"It's been really lovely,\" he said, and he praised Ferrari CEO Benedetto Vigna's dedication to this project and where it might lead down the road. \"Benedetto is an amazing engineer,\" he said, \"he's really interested in what can be learned more broadly.\"\nThe biggest challenge might have been working within the automotive industry. Here, design, form and function are key, but safety is of the utmost importance. \"It's very hard,\" Ive told me. \"I've never worked in an area that's so regulated. Some of it's great, because you understand why, and people's safety is certainly important, but some of it drives you nuts.\"\nIt's far and away the most exciting and fresh interior I've seen outside of the ultra-rare machines like the $4 million Bugatti Tourbillon. But it's so clinically precise and refined that it lacks the rough and raw feel that typifies many classic Ferraris. Whether that's a good or a bad thing will be debated endlessly, and I look forward to reading your comments, but I do figure it'll go a long way to delivering the kind of new clientele that Ferrari must be targeting with the Luce. \nFerrari Luce interior designed by LoveFrom\n\nUltimately, whether anyone will want one is hugely dependent on how good the rest of the car looks and how much it will cost. Those are questions we still can't answer, at least not until May, when CEO Vigna says we can expect the Luce's full reveal. \nFor Ive, though, it seemed like that won't be the end of the road for this automotive journey. \"At the end of a project, there are two products. There's what you've made, and there's what you've learned. I've always been fascinated by what you've learned,\" he told me. \"And honestly, we've learned so much.\"\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/inside-ferraris-luce-ev-the-jony-ive-interior-is-here-130000211.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "The EU could take \"interim measures\" against WhatsApp as it investigates AI providers' access to the app. On Monday, the EU's regulatory arm announced its \"preliminary view\" that Meta, WhatsApp's parent company, violated antitrust laws by blocking third-party AI assistants from operating on WhatsApp. \nThe European Commission's is concerned that Meta's actions will limit competitors from entering the AI assistant market. \"We must protect effective competition in this vibrant field, which means we cannot allow dominant tech companies to illegally leverage their dominance to give themselves an unfair advantage,\" Teresa Ribera, executive vice-president for Clean, Just and Competitive Transition said in a statement. \n\nRibera continued: \"AI markets are developing at rapid pace, so we also need to be swift in our action. That is why we are considering quickly imposing interim measures on Meta, to preserve access for competitors to WhatsApp while the investigation is ongoing, and avoid Meta’s new policy irreparably harming competition in Europe.\" \nThe issue arose in October when Meta announced updates to its WhatsApp Business Solution Terms. According to the European Commission, the January 15 update would \"effectively\" make Meta AI the only AI assistant available on WhatsApp. The regulatory agency opened an investigation into the matter on December 4. \nToday's update stands as a warning to Meta that the European Commission initially believes the company has violated antitrust regulation. A final decision is still to come. It also gave Meta a chance to respond to the allegations — which it swiftly did. \n\"The facts are ‍that there is no reason for the EU to ​intervene in the WhatsApp ‌Business API,\" a Meta spokesperson told Reuters. \"There are many AI options and people can use them from app stores, operating ⁠systems, devices, websites, ​and industry ​partnerships.\" \nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/eu-warns-meta-over-blocking-rival-ai-chatbots-on-whatsapp-121708895.html?src=rss",

Lyft says that parents or guardians can see every ride in real time and manage the account. They also get updates at pickup and drop-off and the app allows communication with the driver when needed.\n\nThis is a rideshare service for teens, so there are several new safety features. The drivers must \"meet the highest standards\" on the platform. Lyft says they get annual background checks and must have \"proven safe driving records, positive passenger interactions and experience behind the wheel.\"\nThe teens have to enter a PIN to ensure the correct rider gets in the car, which is something Lyft has been experimenting with for adults. Audio recording of the ride is on by default, for an added layer of safety.\nLyft Teen is available right now, though not everywhere.

    "source": "Engadget is a web magazine with obsessive daily coverage of everything new in gadgets and consumer electronics",
    "summary": "Apple’s iPhone lineup has grown more complicated over the years, with multiple models targeting different kinds of buyers. Some prioritize camera performance and display quality while others focus on design or price, and not everyone needs the most powerful option on the shelf. If you’re planning an upgrade, the challenge isn’t whether Apple makes a good phone; it’s figuring out which iPhone actually makes sense for you based on how you use it.\nWe test every new iPhone Apple releases, comparing performance, cameras, battery life and long-term value. In this guide, we break down the current lineup to highlight the best iPhones for different needs, from the best all-around picks to more specialized options that trade raw power for affordability or style.\nFor consistency, our recommendations are based on Apple’s standard pricing for unlocked models sold directly through Apple. Deals from carriers, third-party retailers or refurbished sellers can shift the value math, but this guide is meant to help you choose the right model first — then decide where to buy it.\n \nBest iPhones for 2026\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \nThe rest of Apple's iPhone lineup in 2026\n \n\n \n \n  The iPhone 16.\n \n \n \nApple iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus\n \nApple is still selling the last-gen iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Plus for $699 and $799, respectively, but the improvements made with the iPhone 17 have forced both devices into something of a no man’s land. The 16 Plus and its 6.7-inch display might be worth it if you want a large-screen iPhone for a much lower price than the iPhone 17 Pro Max, but you’ll miss out on the base model’s 120Hz always-on display and upgraded dual-camera setup. If you just want a usable iPhone for as little as possible, meanwhile, the iPhone 16e is acceptable for $100 less. In general, we think the iPhone 17 is worth the extra $100; its 6.3-inch display helps it split the difference between the 16 and 16 Plus anyway.\n \niPhone FAQs\n \n\n \n \n \n \nWhen is the best time of year to buy an iPhone?\n \nThe best time to buy an iPhone, or really any product, is whenever you need one. But if you want to maximize how long your iPhone is considered “current,” plan to upgrade in late September. Apple almost always introduces its new core models around then. SE and “e” iPhones, meanwhile, have arrived between February and April, but those aren’t guaranteed annual releases.\n \nCash discounts on new unlocked iPhones are rare, so there usually isn’t much reason to wait for a deal before buying (as is often the case with Samsung or Google phones). Carriers will run their own sales, but those typically involve locking you into years-long service plans. The exception would be if you specifically want an older iPhone, since Apple typically cuts the price of its last-gen devices by $100 or more when it introduces a new model. So, for instance, if you know you won’t care about the inevitable iPhone 17’s upgrades, you could wait until that device is announced and get the iPhone 16 for a little cheaper.\n \nHow long does an iPhone last?\n \nThis depends on the person and how they define “last.” If we had to give a broad estimate, we’d say most iPhone users keep their device between two and four years. If you’re particularly sensitive to performance and camera improvements, you might want to upgrade on the earlier side of that timeline. If you’re not as picky, you could hold out for even longer — though you’ll likely want to get a battery replacement sometime around the three- or four-year mark (or whenever you notice your battery life has severely degraded).\n \nSoftware support shouldn’t be a problem regardless: Apple is renowned for keeping its devices up-to-date long-term, and the current iOS 26 update is available on iPhones dating back to 2019. Most of those older phones don’t support Apple Intelligence, so there isn’t total parity, but that’s not a big loss in the grand scheme of things.\n \nHow do I know how old my iPhone is?\n \nGo to your iPhone’s Settings, then tap General > About. You should see the Model Name right near the top. You can also tap the Model Number below that, then verify the resulting four-digit code on Apple’s identification page to further confirm.\n \nIf you don’t want to use software, for whatever reason, you can also find your iPhone’s model number printed within its USB-C or Lightning port, if the device lacks a SIM tray. For older devices, you can alternatively find that number within the SIM slot or — if you’re still hanging onto an iPhone 7 or older — right on the back of the handset.\n \nRecent updates\n \nSeptember 2025: We’ve overhauled this guide to reflect the release of the new iPhone Air and iPhone 17 series. The base iPhone 17 is our new top pick for most people, while the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max represent the best iPhones you can buy if money is no object. The iPhone Air is worth considering if you care about style above all else, while the iPhone 16e remains acceptable if you want the most affordable new iPhone possible.\n \nAugust 2025: We’ve taken another pass to ensure our advice is still up-to-date and noted that we expect to Apple to launch new phones soon in September.\n \nJune 2025: We’ve lightly edited this guide for clarity and added a few common FAQs. Our picks remain unchanged.\n \nFebruary 2025: The new iPhone 16e replaces the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus as our “budget” pick. We’ve also removed our notes on the iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Plus, and iPhone SE (3rd generation), as each has been formally discontinued.\n \nJanuary 2025: We've made a few minor edits for clarity and ensured our recommendations are still up to date.\n \nDecember 2024: We’ve made a few edits to reflect the release of Apple Intelligence, though our picks remain the same.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/best-iphone-160012979.html?src=rss",

Yes please. “There are infinite possibilities for this to go wrong.” Jennifer Ouellette – Feb 8, 2026 6:26 pm | 106 Credit: YouTube/Amazon MGM Studios Credit: YouTube/Amazon MGM Studios Text settings Story text Size Small Standard Large Width * Standard Wide Links Standard Orange * Subscribers only Learn more Minimize to nav Sure, most Americans are glued to their TVs for today’s Super Bowl and/or the Winter Olympics. But for the non-sports minded, Amazon MGM Studios has released one last trailer for its forthcoming space odyssey Project Hail Mary, based on Andy Weir’s (The Martian) bestselling 2021 novel about an amnesiac biologist-turned-schoolteacher in space. As previously reported, Amazon MGM Studios acquired the rights for Weir’s novel before it was even published and brought on Drew Goddard to write the screenplay. (Goddard also wrote the adapted screenplay for The Martian, so he’s an excellent choice.) The studio tapped Phil Lord and Christopher Miller (Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, The LEGO Movie) to direct and signed on Ryan Gosling to star. Per the official premise: Science teacher Ryland Grace (Ryan Gosling) wakes up on a spaceship light years from home with no recollection of who he is or how he got there. As his memory returns, he begins to uncover his mission: solve the riddle of the mysterious substance causing the sun to die out. He must call on his scientific knowledge and unorthodox ideas to save everything on Earth from extinction… but an unexpected friendship means he may not have to do it alone. In addition to Gosling, the cast includes Sandra Huller as head of the Hail Mary project and Ryland’s superior; Milana Vayntrub as project astronaut Olesya Ilyukhina; Ken Leung as project astronaut Yao Li-Jie; Liz Kingsman as Shapiro; Orion Lee as Xi; and James Ortiz as a new life form Ryland names Rocky. Meet Rocky, a friendly alien whose planet is also in existential peril. YouTube/Amazon MGM Studios Meet Rocky, a friendly alien whose planet is also in existential peril.

YouTube/Amazon MGM Studios A friendship for the ages. YouTube/Amazon MGM Studios Into the great unknown. YouTube/Amazon MGM Studios A friendship for the ages. YouTube/Amazon MGM Studios To say there’s a lot of interest in this movie might be an understatement. The first trailer was released in June and racked up a whopping 400 million views worldwide in its first week. The footage—which included Ryland discovering an alien ship inhabited by the aforementioned Rocky—gave every indication of following Weir’s novel pretty closely. That’s very good news for Weir fans, which includes several of us here at Ars. That earlier trailer mostly gave us a lot of backstory about how Ryland ended up reluctantly agreeing to the mission, with just a few glimpses of Rocky. But Rocky is front and center for this latest one. The footage focuses on how Ryland and Rocky learn to communicate and gradually bond over their shared fates, with strains of Prince’s “I Would Die For You” echoing in the background. It starts with Rocky imitating Ryland’s body motions, including a goofy hero pose. Eventually Ryland figures out how to synthesize a voice for Rocky so they can better coordinate their strategies. Will they succeed? Or is this a one-way trip for one or both of them? Project Hail Mary hits theaters on March 20, 2026.

The movie adapts a 2021 Andy Weir (The Martian) novel of the same name, and follows Dr. Ryland Grace, a scientist who wakes up on a spacecraft far from Earth with no recollection of how he got there or why, only to discover he's on a seemingly impossible mission to stop an extinction event. \nIf you've read the book, you already know we're in for an emotional rollercoaster with this one, and the latest trailer aptly tugs at our heartstrings with a glimpse of the friendship that grows between Grace and an alien he meets after waking up — and the incredibly high stakes they're facing. The movie will be released nationwide on March 20, but Amazon announced alongside this trailer that it'll be offering tickets for early screenings in premium formats including IMAX, Dolby Cinema, 4DX and 70MM to Prime members.

However, AT&T tweaked the Samsung hardware into its kid-friendly smartphone by including features like live location tracking, safe zones and screentime restrictions that can be controlled via the AmiGO app. It's not the first time we've seen a smartphone with parental controls, since competitors like Bark and Pinwheel have been on the market for a couple of years now, but it's the first time a major mobile carrier is offering its own standalone product.\n\nAs for the AmiGO Jr. Phone, it's now available on AT&T's website for $3 a month, but you'll have to commit to a 36-month contract that provides bill credits. You still have to pay for your monthly service charges as an AT&T customer, but it'll be cheaper than buying a Galaxy A16 outright for $200.

Discovery in December at a value of $82.7 billion, the deal was expected to close in 12 to 18 months, subject to required regulatory approvals.

NASA was originally planning a February 15 launch date for the mission, but it has moved it up to February 11. It’s now targeting a liftoff of no earlier than 6:01 AM Eastern that day from Cape Canaveral in Florida. The crew members are already in quarantine, and if everything goes well on launch day, the Dragon capsule they’re on will dock with the orbiting lab at approximately 10:30 AM on February 12. \nIf you’ll recall, NASA decided to bring Crew-11  members back home on January 15, a month earlier than planned, citing a medical concern with one of the members. While the affected astronaut was stable, the ISS didn’t have the equipment necessary to be able to diagnose them properly. All four members of Crew-11 flew home, leaving the whole space station in the hands of three people, namely NASA astronaut Chris Williams and two cosmonauts for the Russian side. They will be joined by Crew-12’s NASA astronauts Jessica Meir and Jack Hathaway, European Space Agency’s Sophie Adenot and Roscosmos cosmonaut Andrey Fedyaev. \nSpaceX recently had to ground its Falcon 9 rocket after an issue with its upper stage for a few days, leaving the Crew-12’s flight schedule in question. But on February 6, the Federal Aviation Administration cleared it for its next flight. NASA will livestream the mission’s prelaunch, launch and docking activities on NASA+, Amazon Prime and on its YouTube channel, with its launch coverage starting at 4AM Eastern time on February 11.

    "source": "Engadget is a web magazine with obsessive daily coverage of everything new in gadgets and consumer electronics",
    "summary": "Apple Health brings sleep tracking, scheduling and long-term analysis into one place, with your iPhone acting as the hub and the Apple Watch doing the overnight monitoring. Once everything is set up, Apple Health can show how long you slept each night, how consistent your sleep schedule is and how much time you spend in different sleep stages. Here is how to get started, track your sleep and review your data.\nSleep tracking in Apple Health relies on two things: You need to set up Sleep in the Health app on your iPhone, and you need a compatible Apple Watch to wear to bed. While you can set sleep schedules without a watch, detailed sleep data — including sleep stages — requires an Apple Watch.\nHow to set up Sleep in Apple Health\nSleep tracking is available on all watchOS 8 (or later) models and setup starts in the Health app on your iPhone. Open Health, tap Browse and then tap Sleep. If this is your first time setting it up, you will see an option to get started. Apple Health will guide you through choosing a sleep goal, setting a bedtime and wake-up time and deciding whether you want one sleep schedule for every day or different schedules for weekdays and weekends.\nDuring setup, you can also enable sleep reminders and a wind-down period. Wind Down reduces distractions before bedtime by activating features like Focus mode and dimming notifications at a set time before sleep. These settings are optional but they help keep your schedule consistent, which improves the quality of the data Apple Health collects over time.\nOnce Sleep is configured, Apple Health automatically syncs those settings to your Apple Watch. You can adjust your sleep schedule later by returning to the Sleep section in Health and tapping Full Schedule and Options. Any changes you make here update on both your iPhone and Apple Watch.\nHow to prepare your Apple Watch for sleep tracking\nTo track sleep, your Apple Watch needs to be worn overnight and have enough battery to last until morning. If the battery drops below 30 percent before bedtime, your watch will prompt you to charge it first. Sleep tracking also relies on Sleep Focus which activates automatically based on your sleep schedule.  Once Sleep Focus has been set, open the Settings app on your Apple Watch, tap Sleep and ensure that Track Sleep with Apple Watch is turned on. With both features enabled your watch can monitor sleep automatically without any manual start or stop each night. \nComfort matters when wearing a watch to bed, so many people prefer a softer band for sleep. As long as the watch fits securely and stays in contact with your wrist, it can track sleep without issue.\nThe Apple Watch Series 11 on a person's wrist, showing a ring with three segmented arcs encircling a Sleep Score of 53 and the description \"OK\" in the bottom left.\nCherlynn Low for Engadget\n\nHow Apple Watch tracks your sleep\nWhen Sleep Focus is active, the Apple Watch uses its accelerometer and heart rate sensor to detect when you are asleep and awake. Newer models also track sleep stages, including time spent in REM, core and deep sleep. Apple Health combines this information into a single overnight record that appears in the Sleep section the next morning.\nYou do not need to start or stop sleep tracking manually. As long as you follow your sleep schedule or enable Sleep Focus before bed, the Apple Watch automatically does everything else. If you wake up early or go to bed later than planned, Apple Health adjusts the data based on actual movement and heart rate rather than just your scheduled times.  In addition, some Apple Watch models (SE 3 or higher) support on-device Siri, enabling you to ask questions such as “how much sleep did I have last night?” for a more immediate response.   \nHow to view your sleep data in Apple Health\nTo see your sleep data, open the Health app on your iPhone and tap Browse, then Sleep. At the top of the screen, you will see a chart showing how long you slept the previous night. Tapping this chart reveals a detailed breakdown, including time asleep, time in bed and sleep stages (if available).\nScrolling down shows trends over longer periods. You can switch between daily, weekly, monthly and six-month views to see patterns in your sleep duration and consistency. Apple Health also highlights whether you are meeting your sleep goal and how regular your schedule has been.\nUnder Highlights, Apple Health may surface insights such as changes in average sleep time, variations in sleep stages or your nightly sleep score. Sleep scores provide a simplified summary of how well you slept, and is based on factors such as duration, consistency and restfulness. These summaries update automatically as more data is collected over time.\nUnderstanding sleep stages and trends\nIf your Apple Watch supports sleep stages, Apple Health displays how much time you spent in REM, core and deep sleep. These stages give context to your overall sleep quality, though Apple emphasizes trends over individual nights. Occasional short nights or unusual stage distributions are normal.\nOver time, Apple Health makes it easier to spot patterns. Consistently short sleep durations, irregular bedtimes or frequent awakenings become clearer when viewing weekly or monthly summaries. This makes the Sleep section useful not just for nightly check-ins but for understanding longer-term habits.\nEditing and managing sleep data\nApple Health allows you to add or edit sleep data if needed manually. In the Sleep section, tap Add Data to log sleep that was not recorded automatically. This can be useful if you forget to wear your watch or take a nap without it.\nYou can also manage which devices contribute sleep data by scrolling to the bottom of the Sleep screen and tapping Data Sources and Access. This is helpful if you use third-party sleep apps or multiple devices.\nOnce set up, sleep tracking in Apple Health runs quietly in the background. With a consistent schedule and a charged Apple Watch, your sleep data builds into a clear picture of your nightly rest, all stored securely within Apple’s health platform.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/how-to-track-your-sleep-and-view-your-sleep-data-in-apple-health-130000023.html?src=rss",

Read on for a roundup of the most compelling new gear we’ve tested recently from gaming, PCs, cameras and more. \nNex Playground\n\nIf you still have a fondness for the Xbox Kinect, the Nex Playground might be right up your alley. Senior reporter Devindra Hardawar recently put the tiny box through its paces and found an active gaming experience that’s fun for the whole family. “While I have some concerns about the company’s subscription model, Nex has accomplished a rare feat: It developed a simple box that makes it easy for your entire family to jump into genuinely innovative games and experiences,” he wrote.\nMSI's Prestige 14 Flip AI+\n\nDevindra also tested MSI’s latest laptop, the powerful Prestige 14 Flip AI+. While the machine got high marks for its performance, display and connectivity, he noted that the overall experience is hindered by subpar keyboard and truly awful trackpad. “As one of the earliest Panther Lake laptops on the market, the $1,299 Prestige 14 Flip AI+ is a solid machine, if you're willing to overlook its touchpad flaws,” he explained. “More than anything though, the Prestige 14 makes me excited to see what other PC makers offer with Intel's new chips.”\nShokz OpenFit Pro\n\nFresh off of its Best of CES selection, I conducted a full review of the OpenFit Pro earbuds from Shokz. I continue to be impressed by the earbuds’ ability to reduce ambient noise while keeping your ears open. And the overall sound quality is excellent for a product that sits outside of your ears. \nSony A7 V\n\nContributing reporter Steve Dent has been busy testing cameras to start the year. This week he added the Sony A7 V to the list, noting the excellent photo quality and accurate autofocus. “The A7 V is an incredible camera for photography, with speeds, autofocus accuracy and image quality ahead of rivals, including the Canon R6 III, Panasonic S1 II and Nikon Z6 III,” he said. “However, Sony isn’t keeping up with those models for video.” \nApple AirTag (2026)\n\nOur first Editors’ Choice device of 2026 is Apple’s updated AirTag. All of the upgrades lead to a better overall item tracker, according to UK bureau chief Mat Smith. “There's no doubt the second-gen AirTags are improved, and thankfully, upgrading to the new capabilities doesn’t come at too steep a cost,” he concluded. \nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/engadget-review-recap-shokz-openfit-pro-nex-playground-sony-a7-v-and-more-123400089.html?src=rss",

Credit: Brett Coomer/Houston Chronicle via Getty Images Text settings Story text Size Small Standard Large Width * Standard Wide Links Standard Orange * Subscribers only Learn more Minimize to nav Enforcement against polluters in the United States plunged in the first year of President Donald Trump’s second term, a far bigger drop than in the same period of his first term, according to a new report from a watchdog group. By analyzing a range of federal court and administrative data, the nonprofit Environmental Integrity Project found that civil lawsuits filed by the US Department of Justice in cases referred by the Environmental Protection Agency dropped to just 16 in the first 12 months after Trump’s inauguration on Jan. 20, 2025. That is 76 percent less than in the first year of the Biden administration. Trump’s first administration filed 86 such cases in its first year, which was in turn a drop from the Obama administration’s 127 four years earlier. “Our nation’s landmark environmental laws are meaningless when EPA does not enforce the rules,” Jen Duggan, executive director of the Environmental Integrity Project, said in a statement. The findings echo two recent analyses from the nonprofits Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility and Earthjustice, which both documented dwindling environmental enforcement under Trump. From day one of Trump’s second term, the administration has pursued an aggressive deregulatory agenda, scaling back regulations and health safeguards across the federal government that protect water, air, and other parts of the environment. This push to streamline industry activities has been particularly favorable for fossil fuel companies. Trump declared an “energy emergency” immediately after his inauguration. At the EPA, Administrator Lee Zeldin launched in March what the administration called the “biggest deregulatory action in US history”: 31 separate efforts to roll back restrictions on air and water pollution; to hand over more authority to states, some of which have a long history of supporting lax enforcement; and to relinquish EPA’s mandate to act on climate change under the Clean Air Act. The new report suggests the agency is also relaxing enforcement of existing law. Neither the White House nor the EPA responded to a request for comment. A “compliance first” approach Part of the decline in lawsuits against polluters could be due to the lack of staff to carry them out, experts say. According to an analysis from E&E News, at least a third of lawyers in the Justice Department’s environment division have left in the past year. Meanwhile, the EPA in 2025 laid off hundreds of employees who monitored pollution that could hurt human health. Top agency officials are also directing staff to issue fewer violation notices and reduce other enforcement actions. In December, the EPA formalized a new “compliance first” enforcement policy that stresses working with suspected violators to correct problems before launching any formal action that could lead to fines or mandatory correction measures. “Formal enforcement … is appropriate only when compliance assurance or informal enforcement is inapplicable or insufficient to achieve rapid compliance,” wrote Craig Pritzlaff, who is now a principal deputy assistant EPA administrator, in a December 5 memo to all enforcement officials and regional offices. Only in rare cases involving an immediate hazard should enforcers use traditional case tools, Pritzlaff said. “Immediate formal enforcement may be required in certain circumstances, such as when there is an emergency that presents significant harm to human health and the environment,” he wrote. Federal agencies like the EPA, with staffs far outmatched in size compared to the vast sectors of the economy they oversee, typically have used enforcement actions not only to deal with violators but to deter other companies from breaking the law. Environmental advocates worry that without environmental cops visible on the beat, compliance will erode. Pritzlaff joined the EPA last fall after five years heading up enforcement for the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, where nonprofit watchdog group Public Citizen noted that he was known as a “reluctant regulator.” Public Citizen and other advocacy groups criticized TCEQ under Pritzlaff’s leadership for its reticence to take decisive action against repeat violators. One example: An INEOS chemical plant had racked up close to 100 violations over a decade before a 2023 explosion that sent one worker to the hospital, temporarily shut down the Houston Ship Channel and sparked a fire that burned for an hour. Public Citizen said it was told by TCEQ officials that the agency allowed violations to accumulate over the years, arguing it was more efficient to handle multiple issues in a single enforcement action. “But that proved to be untrue, instead creating a complex backlog of cases that the agency is still struggling to resolve,” Public Citizen wrote last fall after Pritzlaff joined the EPA. “That’s not efficiency, it’s failure.” Early last year, TCEQ fined INEOS $2.3 million for an extensive list of violations that occurred between 2016 and 2021. “A slap on the wrist” The EPA doesn’t always take entities to court when they violate environmental laws. At times, the agency can resolve these issues through less-formal administrative cases, which actually increased during the first eight months of Trump’s second term when compared to the same period in the Biden administration, according to the new report. However, most of these administrative actions involved violations of requirements for risk management plans under the Clean Air Act or municipalities’ violations of the Safe Drinking Water Act. The Trump administration did not increase administrative cases that involve pollution from industrial operations, Environmental Integrity Project spokesperson Tom Pelton said over email. Another signal of declining enforcement: Through September of last year, the EPA issued $41 million in penalties—$8 million less than the same period in the first year of the Biden administration, after adjusting for inflation. This suggests “the Trump Administration may be letting more polluters get by with a slap on the wrist when the Administration does take enforcement action,” the report reads. Combined, the lack of lawsuits, penalties, and other enforcement actions for environmental violations could impact communities across the country, said Erika Kranz, a senior staff attorney in the Environmental and Energy Law Program at Harvard Law School, who was not involved in the report. “We’ve been seeing the administration deregulate by repealing rules and extending compliance deadlines, and this decline in enforcement action seems like yet another mechanism that the administration is using to de-emphasize environmental and public health protections,” Kranz said. “It all appears to be connected, and if you’re a person in the US who is worried about your health and the health of your neighbors generally, this certainly could have effects.” The report notes that many court cases last longer than a year, so it will take time to get a clearer sense of how environmental enforcement is changing under the Trump administration. However, the early data compiled by the Environmental Integrity Project and other nonprofits shows a clear and steep shift away from legal actions against polluters. Historically, administrations have a “lot of leeway on making enforcement decisions,” Kranz said. But this stark of a drop could prompt lawsuits against the Trump administration, she added. “Given these big changes and trends, you might see groups arguing that this is more than just an exercise of discretion or choosing priorities [and] this is more of an abdication of an agency’s core mission and its statutory duties,” Kranz said. “I think it’s going to be interesting to see if groups make those arguments, and if they do, how courts look at them.” This article originally appeared on Inside Climate News, a nonprofit, non-partisan news organization that covers climate, energy, and the environment.

    "summary": "Welcome to our latest roundup of what's going on in the indie game space. As always, we've got a bunch of neat games to tell you about. Perhaps I'll tear myself away from playing as Chappell Roan in Fortnite or Jetpack Cat in Overwatch long enough to check more of them out.\nThanks to the folks at Aftermath, I learned about a short, text-based game from Woe Industries from a while back called You Have Billions Invested In Generative AI. Surprisingly enough, you take on the role of a venture capitalist who has plowed gobs of money into genAI technology and might be starting to have doubts about that investment. Other characters warn you about the dangers of the tech and real-life headlines showing the impact of genAI hallucinations pop up. It's tagged as a horror game, for what it's worth. \nIt's both satirical and all too real, and it's pretty funny. Plus, any game that allows me to yell at Noam Chomsky is A-OK in my book. You can play You Have Billions Invested In Generative AI for free on Itch.io.\nNew releases\n\n\n\nTackle for Loss had a very timely arrival this week, just ahead of a certain other big, real-life game. This is a football-themed take on action-heavy, top-down games like Hotline Miami. Developer Indifferent Penguin took some inspiration from the Taken film series as well — you take on the role of a CTE-afflicted former football player who sets out to rescue his kidnapped daughter.\nThe combat sounds pretty interesting here. You need to clear out all of the bad guys on each floor of a multistory building before you can progress, but you only have four offensive actions at your disposal each time (this draws from the four-down format of football). You'll need to plan things out before you go on the attack, not least because your character and the enemies all die in a single hit.\nTackle for Loss is out now on Steam. It'll usually run you $11, but it's 15 percent off until February 12. \n\n\n\nTrust Me, I Nailed It is an intriguing turn-based strategy game from Team Afternoon and publisher Jungle Game Lab. A useless warrior hires you as a video editor to make them look like a true hero capable of slaying any beast. \nEnemy attacks and other actions appear on the edit timeline as pre-recorded footage, and the idea is to plot out the warrior's movements around those. You have post-processing visual effects tricks at your disposal, so you can let the warrior teleport and convert low-power strikes into critical hits.\nIt's a fun idea, and a reminder (as if we should need one in the current climate) not to always take videos at face value. Trust Me, I Nailed It is on Steam now and it's free-to-play.\n\n\n\nTomb of the Bloodletter is a spin on the roguelike deckbuilder genre that I haven't really seen before. Your deck consists of magic powers that are applied to letters of the alphabet. Spelling out words using these Magicks can result in powerful combinations, particularly if you use the same letter multiple times. That's right, this is a typing game — a roguelike deckbuilder that the likes of Wordle players might be interested in.\nIt's really about coming up with words that put the right letters in a specific order. For instance, certain letters are more effective if you place them at the end of a word. So, this should get your brain ticking.  \nTomb of the Bloodletter — from Ethan's Secretions and indie.io — debuted during the Steam Typing Fest. It'll typically cost $8, but there's a 20 percent discount until February 19.\nUpcoming \n\n\n\nShadowstone is an upcoming turn-based tactical co-op roguelike for up to four players from developer Secret Door and Dreamhaven (Blizzard co-founder and ex-CEO Mike Morhaime's company). It's set in the same universe as Secret Door's Sunderfolk. \nThe action plays out on a hexagonal board with randomized rooms and enemies. Positioning will be key, and finding synergies between the abilities of the playable characters will put you in good stead.\nShadowstone will hit Steam in early access later this year for $15. It's also coming to the Epic Games Store.\nMeanwhile, a major update for Sunderfolk is set to go live on March 10. It will introduce a new tank-style character and two fresh sets of missions. Secret Door will also add two much-requested features to PC versions: online multiplayer and — so you don't have to use your phone to play the game anymore — mouse and keyboard controls.\n\n\n\nI really loved Planet of Lana and the sequel is among my most-anticipated games of this year. There's now a release date for the upcoming puzzle platformer. Wishfully and Thunderful Publishing are bringing it to Steam, Xbox, PlayStation and Nintendo Switch on March 5. It'll also be on Game Pass on day one.\nA Planet of Lana II: Children of the Leaf demo will hit Steam, Xbox and PlayStation on February 11. It will arrive on Switch a bit later.\n\n\n\nIs Sticker/Ball the first Ball x Pit-like? I'm not entirely sure. Still, it is now firmly on my radar. Instead of firing balls at a horde of constantly-advancing enemies, here you'll shoot them at dice to earn points. You'll unlock stickers that can be applied to said dice and they’ll interact with each other too. For instance, spiders can create webs and these can catch flies that are attracted to poop stickers. \nThe trailer describes another interaction, \"frog jumped and triggered cigarette pack.\" Frogs can also hijack spaceships, apparently, and there's a bouncing DVD (well, \"VID\") logo. There are more than 100 types of stickers and dozens of different enemies.\nI don't really understand what's going on in the trailer, but it's somehow making my brain happy, so this is going on my wishlist. Solo dev Bilge is behind Sticker/Ball, which is coming to Steam soon through the help of publisher Future Friends Games. A demo is available now, so that's my weekend sorted.\n\n\n\nSkate City has long been one of the best games on Apple Arcade. Its creator, Daniel Zeller, (Zellah Games) has revealed a new project. Skate Style is billed as a \"next-gen skateboarding game with high-end graphics.\" You'll be able to take to the virtual streets of Barcelona and Prague to show off your best moves. \nWhat could help Skate Style really stand out from the pack is the animation editor, which enables you to create completely new tricks. The game is slated to have an \"advanced\" character creation tool as well as mod support, so there'll be a high level of customization available. \nA Skate Style demo is available on Steam now. The full game should land on PC later this year. Here's hoping the soundtrack can match up to those from the Tony Hawk's Pro Skater series.\n\n\n\nCrimson Capes is billed as a 2D Soulslike action RPG with four playable characters, elemental magic, more than 25 bosses, swordfighting, lots of secrets, co-op, optional hunts with randomized dungeons and invasions from other players. That all sounds neat enough, but most exciting to me here is the pixel-art, rotoscoped animation work. It looks modern and retro at the same time, and I'd love to see this sort of style in more games. I also dig that you get a PDF instruction manual and game guide as well as a printable world map when you buy the game.\nYou (and I) won't have to wait long to play Crimson Capes, which is from Poor Locke. It's coming to Steam on February 12 for $15, though you'll get 10 percent off if you pick it up within the first nine days. Console versions are in the pipeline too. \nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/hotline-miami-meets-football-the-power-of-video-editing-and-other-new-indie-games-worth-checking-out-120000628.html?src=rss",

But as usual with claims of AI-related achievement, you’ll find some key caveats ahead. On Thursday, Anthropic researcher Nicholas Carlini published a blog post describing how he set 16 instances of the company’s Claude Opus 4.6 AI model loose on a shared codebase with minimal supervision, tasking them with building a C compiler from scratch. Over two weeks and nearly 2,000 Claude Code sessions costing about $20,000 in API fees, the AI model agents reportedly produced a 100,000-line Rust-based compiler capable of building a bootable Linux 6.9 kernel on x86, ARM, and RISC-V architectures. Carlini, a research scientist on Anthropic’s Safeguards team who previously spent seven years at Google Brain and DeepMind, used a new feature launched with Claude Opus 4.6 called “agent teams.” In practice, each Claude instance ran inside its own Docker container, cloning a shared Git repository, claiming tasks by writing lock files, then pushing completed code back upstream. No orchestration agent directed traffic. Each instance independently identified whatever problem seemed most obvious to work on next and started solving it. When merge conflicts arose, the AI model instances resolved them on their own. The resulting compiler, which Anthropic has released on GitHub, can compile a range of major open source projects, including PostgreSQL, SQLite, Redis, FFmpeg, and QEMU. It achieved a 99 percent pass rate on the GCC torture test suite and, in what Carlini called “the developer’s ultimate litmus test,” compiled and ran Doom. It’s worth noting that a C compiler is a near-ideal task for semi-autonomous AI model coding: The specification is decades old and well-defined, comprehensive test suites already exist, and there’s a known good reference compiler to check against. Most real-world software projects have none of these advantages. The hard part of most development isn’t writing code that passes tests; it’s figuring out what the tests should be in the first place. The compiler also has clear limitations that Carlini was upfront about. It lacks a 16-bit x86 backend needed to boot Linux from real mode, so it calls out to GCC for that step. Its own assembler and linker remain buggy. Even with all optimizations enabled, it produces less-efficient code than GCC running with all optimizations disabled. And the Rust code quality, while functional, does not approach what an expert Rust programmer would produce. “The resulting compiler has nearly reached the limits of Opus’s abilities,” Carlini wrote. “I tried (hard!) to fix several of the above limitations but wasn’t fully successful. New features and bugfixes frequently broke existing functionality.” Those limitations may actually be more informative than the successes. Carlini reports that toward the end of the project, fixing bugs and adding features “frequently broke existing functionality,” a pattern familiar to anyone who has watched a codebase grow beyond the point where any contributor fully understands it. And that limitation is even more common when dealing with AI coding agents, which lose coherence over time. The model hit this wall at around 100,000 lines, which suggests a practical ceiling for autonomous agentic coding, at least with current models. The human work behind the automation Anthropic describes the compiler as a “clean-room implementation” because the agents had no Internet access during development. But that framing is somewhat misleading. The underlying model was trained on enormous quantities of publicly available source code, almost certainly including GCC, Clang, and numerous smaller C compilers. In traditional software development, “clean room” specifically means the implementers have never seen the original code. By that standard, this isn’t one. On Hacker News, the distinction drew sharp debate, reflective of a controversial reception to the news among developers. “It was rather a brute force attempt to decompress fuzzily stored knowledge contained within the network,” wrote one commenter. The $20,000 figure also deserves some context. That number covers only API token costs and excludes the billions spent training the model, the human labor Carlini invested in building the scaffolding, and the decades of work by compiler engineers who created the test suites and reference implementations that made the project possible. And that scaffolding was not trivial, which makes any claim of “autonomous” work on the C compiler among the AI agents dubious. While the headline result is a compiler written without human pair-programming, much of the real work that made the project function involved designing the environment around the AI model agents rather than writing compiler code directly. Carlini spent considerable effort building test harnesses, continuous integration pipelines, and feedback systems tuned for the specific ways language models fail. He found, for example, that verbose test output polluted the model’s context window, causing it to lose track of what it was doing. To address this, Carlini designed test runners that printed only a few summary lines and logged details to separate files. He also found that Claude has no sense of time and will spend hours running tests without making progress, so he built a fast mode that samples only 1 percent to 10 percent of test cases. When all 16 agents got stuck trying to fix the same Linux kernel bug simultaneously, he used GCC as a reference oracle, randomly compiling most kernel files with GCC and only a subset with Claude’s compiler, so each agent could work on different bugs in different files. “Claude will work autonomously to solve whatever problem I give it,” Carlini wrote. “So it’s important that the task verifier is nearly perfect, otherwise Claude will solve the wrong problem.” None of this should obscure what the project actually demonstrates. A year ago, no language model could have produced anything close to a functional multi-architecture compiler, even with this kind of babysitting and an unlimited budget. The methodology of parallel agents coordinating through Git with minimal human supervision is novel, and the engineering tricks Carlini developed to keep the agents productive (context-aware test output, time-boxing, the GCC oracle for parallelization) could potentially represent useful contributions to the wider use of agentic software development tools. Carlini himself acknowledged feeling conflicted about his own results. “Building this compiler has been some of the most fun I’ve had recently, but I did not expect this to be anywhere near possible so early in 2026,” he wrote. He also raised concerns rooted in his previous career in penetration testing, noting that “the thought of programmers deploying software they’ve never personally verified is a real concern.” Benj Edwards Senior AI Reporter Benj Edwards Senior AI Reporter Benj Edwards is Ars Technica's Senior AI Reporter and founder of the site's dedicated AI beat in 2022.

As the rumor goes, having a bigger bulge on a required 3D body scan taken in the pre-season could earn jumpers extra centimeters of material in their jumpsuits—and a suit’s larger nether regions provide more surface area to glide to the gold. Even a small increase can make a satisfying difference in this sport. A 2025 simulation-based study published in the journal Frontiers in Sports and Active Living suggested that every 2 cm of extra fabric in a ski jumpsuit could increase drag by about 4 percent and increase lift by about 5 percent. On a jump, that extra 2 cm of fabric amounts to an extra 5.8 meters, the simulations found. Elite ski jumpers are aware of the advantage and have already crotch-rocketed to scandal with related schemes. Last year, two Norwegian Olympic medalists, Marius Lindvik and Johann Andre Forfang, and three of their team officials were charged with cheating after an anonymous video showed the head coach and suit technician illegally restitching the crotch area of the two jumpers’ suits to make them larger. The jumpers received a three-month suspension, while the head coach, an assistant coach, and the technician faced a harsher 18-month ban. Injections are alleged to be a new, more drastic strategy. Rumors that jumpers were internally padding their peckers first came to light in January, when German newspaper Bild reported that there were “whispers” of jumpers using hyaluronic acid or possibly paraffin injections. Bild quoted Dr. Kamran Karim, a specialist at Maria-Hilf Hospital in Krefeld, Germany, as saying (translated): “There is the possibility of obtaining a temporary, optical thickening of the penis with the injection of paraffin or hyaluronic acid. … Such an injection, however, is not medically indicated and involves risks.” On Thursday, the injection claims sprang up again at a press conference in which journalists asked officials of the World Anti-Doping Agency about the claims. The agency’s director general said they were not aware of any claims and that non-doping means of enhancing performance are not in their purview. But according to the BBC, WADA President Witold Banka, who is from Poland, was “clearly entertained” by the questions, responding: “Ski jumping is very popular in Poland, so I promise you I’m going to look at it.” Bruno Sassi, the communications director for FIS, the international ski and snowboard federation, seemed less amused, telling the BBC, “There has never been any indication, let alone evidence, that any competitor has ever made use of a hyaluronic acid injection to attempt to gain a competitive advantage.” But what if they did? Here’s what we know about hyaluronic acid and paraffin for penis augmentation. Hyaluronic acid While some news outlets have played up the “acid” part of its name, hyaluronic acid is not some nefarious flesh-melting hazard. It’s a common filler used for various clinical purposes. Hyaluronic acid is a polysaccharide that is naturally found in a wide variety of tissues in the human body, including the skin, eyes, and connective tissue. It’s a chief component of the extracellular matrix. It attracts water molecules to itself, creating volume that can provide structural support. In a pure form, it has no tissue or even species specificity and therefore is considered to have little risk of sparking immune responses. As such, hyaluronic acid gel fillers are used in a variety of medical procedures, with approval from the Food and Drug Administration. Hyaluronic acid (HA) fillers are injected into joints, particularly knees, to relieve pain from mild to moderate arthritis, which can decrease the natural amount of HA in joints. Age also decreases natural levels of HA, and one of the main uses of HA fillers is for cosmetic purposes—plumping lips and cheeks, and minimizing the appearance of wrinkles and fine lines in the face. HA fillers can also be used inside the eye in a variety of surgeries, including cataract extraction and corneal transplants. It can also be used topically for wound care and to relieve skin pain and itching. For these purposes, the most common adverse effects are pain, bruising, redness, itching, and swelling, which usually last for just a few days. In extremely rare cases, there can be more serious side effects from injections, such as bacterial infections, tissue death (from blocked blood flow), and a granulomatous foreign body reaction, in which the immune system tries to clear a foreign substance, such as bacterial impurities, leading to a collection of immune cells. A notable feature of HA fillers is that they have something of an antidote. For procedures that go wrong for whatever reason, clinicians can use hyaluronidase, an enzyme that breaks down hyaluronic acid, to dissolve the filler. Hyaluronidase is then rapidly deactivated and degraded in the body. But even without any dissolving, HA fillers offer only temporary effects, lasting between eight weeks and up to six months, for the various established uses. Plumping penises What is not on the list of established clinical purposes for HA fillers is penis augmentation. But that’s not from a lack of trying. Studies have looked at the possibility of using HA fillers for adding girth and length—and some have reported positive results. But so far, there’s a lack of evidence to support safety and efficacy. Still, that hasn’t stopped cosmetic clinics around the world from offering it anyway. In a 2022 study in the Asian Journal of Andrology, researchers in China followed 38 patients who had HA filler injections, which seemed to provide the desired results. One month after injections, the men saw an average increase of 3.4 cm in girth and 2.5 cm in length when flaccid. After a year, the measurements had decreased but were still an increase of 2.4 cm in girth and 1.65 cm in length. Erect girth ended at an average increase of 0.8 cm. The researchers reported that only three patients had complications: two had swelling, and one had bleeding under the skin. All three cases resolved on their own. However, not all reports are so rosy. In a 2021 case study in BMC Urology, researchers in Australia reported the experience of a 31-year-old man who received penis HA fillers at a cosmetic clinic. He developed a severe penis infection soon after that led to sepsis and multi-organ failure, landing him in the intensive care unit. Doctors ended up surgically removing pus-stained filler from his penis, which laboratory tests found teeming with Streptococcus pyogenes. Another case study in 2021, published in a Japanese urology journal, reported that a 65-year-old man had to have part of his penis surgically removed after having HA fillers injected into the head of his penis. When he arrived at the hospital, black necrotic lesions and ulcers were readily visible. Paraffin While things can go wrong with HA fillers, despite their legitimate clinical uses, the outcomes for paraffin injections are much darker. Amid the Olympics scandal, most of the focus has been on hyaluronic acid. But the initial Bild article introduced speculation that skiers could also use paraffin injections to jack up their junk, which would be a terrible idea. The use of injections of mineral oil or paraffin wax for cosmetic procedures dates back to at least 1899, when it was almost immediately found to have horrifying results. The injections lead to what’s called paraffinoma, in which the body tries to encapsulate and sequester the oil it can’t degrade. The result is tissue that looks like swiss cheese—with large spaces filled with oil. Over time, the tissue becomes thickened and scarred and can block lymphatic drainage. From the outside, it results in disfiguring and debilitating lesions. Some people initially ignored these disturbing results because, in some cases, the lesions can take years to develop. While such injections have largely been abandoned, cases occasionally crop up. That includes a 2002 report of a 64-year-old Michigan man who self-injected his penis with mineral oil to increase its girth. He used a series of shots over the course of 18 months. Two years after the last shot, he went to urologists because of an increasing mass in his penis that was causing erectile dysfunction and making it difficult to urinate. He reluctantly admitted to the oil injections only after his doctors suspected cancer. In the end, the doctors had to surgically remove the mass of oily nodules from all around his penis and circumcise him. Whatever is going on in the trousers of Olympic ski jumpers, let’s hope it doesn’t involve paraffin.

Ashley Belanger – Feb 6, 2026 5:43 pm | 133 Credit: akinbostanci | iStock / Getty Images Plus Credit: akinbostanci | iStock / Getty Images Plus Text settings Story text Size Small Standard Large Width * Standard Wide Links Standard Orange * Subscribers only Learn more Minimize to nav Frustrated by fake citations and flowery prose packed with “out-of-left-field” references to ancient libraries and Ray Bradbury’s Fahrenheit 451, a New York federal judge took the rare step of terminating a case this week due to a lawyer’s repeated misuse of AI when drafting filings. In an order on Thursday, District Judge Katherine Polk Failla ruled that the extraordinary sanctions were warranted after an attorney, Steven Feldman, kept responding to requests to correct his filings with documents containing fake citations. One of those filings was “noteworthy,” Failla said, “for its conspicuously florid prose.” Where some of Feldman’s filings contained grammatical errors and run-on sentences, this filing seemed glaringly different stylistically. It featured, the judge noted, “an extended quote from Ray Bradbury’s Fahrenheit 451 and metaphors comparing legal advocacy to gardening and the leaving of indelible ‘mark[s] upon the clay.’” The Bradbury quote is below: “Everyone must leave something behind when he dies, my grandfather said. A child or a book or a painting or a house or a wall built or a pair of shoes made. Or a garden planted. Something your hand touched some way so your soul has somewhere to go when you die, and when people look at that tree or that flower you planted, you’re there. It doesn’t matter what you do, he said, so long as you change something from the way it was before you touched it into something that’s like you after you take your hands away. The difference between the man who just cuts lawns and a real gardener is in the touching, he said. The lawn-cutter might just as well not have been there at all; the gardener will be there a lifetime.” Another passage Failla highlighted as “raising the Court’s eyebrows” curiously invoked a Bible passage about divine judgment as a means of acknowledging the lawyer’s breach of duty in not catching the fake citations: “Your Honor, in the ancient libraries of Ashurbanipal, scribes carried their stylus as both tool and sacred trust—understanding that every mark upon clay would endure long beyond their mortal span. As the role the mark (x) in Ezekiel Chapter 9, that marked the foreheads with a tav (x) of blood and ink, bear the same solemn recognition: that the written word carries power to preserve or condemn, to build or destroy, and leaves an indelible mark which cannot be erased but should be withdrawn, let it lead other to think these citations were correct. I have failed in that sacred trust. The errors in my memorandum, however inadvertent, have diminished the integrity of the record and the dignity of these proceedings. Like the scribes of antiquity who bore their stylus as both privilege and burden, I understand that legal authorship demands more than mere competence—it requires absolute fidelity to truth and precision in every mark upon the page.” Lawyer claims AI did not write filings Although the judge believed the “florid prose” signaled that a chatbot wrote the draft, Feldman denied that. In a hearing transcript in which the judge weighed possible sanctions, Feldman testified that he wrote every word of the filings. He explained that he read the Bradbury book “many years ago” and wanted to include “personal things” in that filing. And as for his references to Ashurbanipal, that also “came from me,” he said. Instead of admitting he had let an AI draft his filings, he maintained that his biggest mistake was relying on various AI programs to review and cross-check citations. Among the tools that he admitted using included Paxton AI, vLex’s Vincent AI, and Google’s NotebookLM. Essentially, he testified that he substituted three rounds of AI review for one stretch reading through all the cases he was citing. That misstep allowed hallucinations and fake citations to creep into the filings, he said. But the judge pushed back, writing in her order that it was “extremely difficult to believe” that AI did not draft those sections containing overwrought prose. She accused Feldman of dodging the truth. “The Court sees things differently: AI generated this citation from the start, and Mr. Feldman’s decision to remove most citations and write ‘more of a personal letter'” is “nothing but an ex post justification that seeks to obscure his misuse of AI and his steadfast refusal to review his submissions for accuracy,” Failla wrote. At the hearing, she expressed frustration and annoyance at Feldman for evading her questions and providing inconsistent responses. Eventually, he testified that he used AI to correct information when drafting one of the filings, which Failla immediately deemed “unwise,” but not the one quoting Bradbury. AI is not a substitute for going to the library Feldman is one of hundreds of lawyers who have relied on AI to draft filings, which have introduced fake citations into cases. Lawyers have offered a wide range of excuses for relying too much on AI. Some have faced small fines, around $150, while others have been slapped with thousands in fines, including one case where sanctions reached $85,000 for repeated, abusive misconduct. At least one law firm has threatened to fire lawyers citing fake cases, and other lawyers have imposed other voluntary sanctions, like taking a yearlong leave of absence. Seemingly, Feldman did not think sanctions were warranted in this case. In his defense of three filings containing 14 errors out of 60 total citations, Feldman discussed his challenges accessing legal databases due to high subscription costs and short library hours. With more than one case on his plate and his kids’ graduations to attend, he struggled to verify citations during times when he couldn’t make it to the library, he testified. As a workaround, he relied on several AI programs to verify citations that he found by searching on tools like Google Scholar. Feldman likely did not expect the judge to terminate the case as a result of his AI misuses. Asked how he thought the court should resolve things, Feldman suggested that he could correct the filings by relying on other attorneys to review citations, while avoiding “any use whatsoever of any, you know, artificial intelligence or LLM type of methods.” The judge, however, wrote that his repeated misuses were “proof” that he “learned nothing” and had not implemented voluntary safeguards to catch the errors. Asked for comment, Feldman told Ars that he did not have time to discuss the sanctions but that he hopes his experience helps raise awareness of how inaccessible court documents are to the public. “Use of AI, and the ability to improve it, exposes a deeper proxy fight over whether law and serious scholarship remain publicly auditable, or drift into closed, intermediary‑controlled systems that undermine verification and due process,” Feldman suggested. “The real lesson is about transparency and system design, not simply tool failure,” Feldman said. But at the hearing, Failla said that she thinks Feldman had “access to the walled garden” of legal databases, if only he “would go to the law library” to do his research, rather than rely on AI tools. “It sounds like you want me to say that you should be absolved of all of these terrible citation errors, these missed citations, because you don’t have Westlaw,” the judge said. “But now I know you have access to Westlaw. So what do you want?” As Failla explained in her order, she thinks the key takeaway is that Feldman routinely failed to catch his own errors. She said that she has no problem with lawyers using AI to assist their research, but Feldman admitted to not reading the cases that he cited and “apparently” cannot “learn from his mistakes.” Verifying case citations should never be a job left to AI, Failla said, describing Feldman’s research methods as “redolent of Rube Goldberg.” “Most lawyers simply call this ‘conducting legal research,’” Failla wrote. “All lawyers must know how to do it. Mr. Feldman is not excused from this professional obligation by dint of using emerging technology.” His “explanations were thick on words but thin on substance,” the judge wrote. She concluded that he “repeatedly and brazenly” violated Rule 11, which requires attorneys to verify the cases that they cite, “despite multiple warnings.” Noting that Feldman “failed to fully accept responsibility,” she ruled that case-terminating sanctions were necessary, entering default judgment for the plaintiffs. Feldman may also be on the hook to pay fees for wasting other attorneys’ time. Case’s abrupt end triggers extensive remedies The hearing transcript has circulated on social media due to the judge’s no-nonsense approach to grilling Feldman, whom she clearly found evasive and lacking credibility. “Look, if you don’t want to be straight with me, if you don’t want to answer questions with candor, that’s fine,” Failla said. “I’ll just make my own decisions about what I think you did in this case. I’m giving you an opportunity to try and explain something that I think cannot be explained.” In her order this week, she noted that Feldman “struggled to make eye contact” and left the court without “clear answers.” Feldman’s errors came in a case in which a toy company sued merchants who allegedly failed to stop selling stolen goods after receiving a cease-and-desist order. His client was among the merchants accused of illegally profiting from the alleged thefts. They faced federal charges of trademark infringement, unfair competition, and false advertising, as well as New York charges, including fostering the sale of stolen goods. The loss triggers remedies, including an injunction preventing additional sales of stolen goods and refunding every customer who bought them. Feldman’s client must also turn over any stolen goods in their remaining inventory and disgorge profits. Other damages may be owed, along with interest. Ars could not immediately reach an attorney for the plaintiffs to discuss the sanctions order or resulting remedies. Failla emphasized in her order that Feldman appeared to not appreciate “the gravity of the situation,” repeatedly submitting filings with fake citations even after he had been warned that sanctions could be ordered. That was a choice, Failla said, noting that Feldman’s mistakes were caught early by a lawyer working for another defendant in the case, Joel MacMull, who urged Feldman to promptly notify the court. The whole debacle would have ended in June 2025, MacMull suggested at the hearing. Rather than take MacMull’s advice, however, Feldman delayed notifying the court, irking the judge. He testified during the heated sanctions hearing that the delay was due to an effort he quietly undertook, working to correct the filing. He supposedly planned to submit those corrections when he alerted the court to the errors. But Failla noted that he never submitted corrections, insisting instead that Feldman kept her “in the dark.” “There’s no real reason why you should have kept this from me,” the judge said. The court learned of the fake citations only after MacMull notified the judge by sharing emails of his attempts to get Feldman to act urgently. Those emails showed Feldman scolding MacMull for unprofessional conduct after MacMull refused to check Feldman’s citations for him, which Failla noted at the hearing was absolutely not MacMull’s responsibility. Feldman told Failla that he also thought it was unprofessional for MacMull to share their correspondence, but Failla said the emails were “illuminative.” At the hearing, MacMull asked if the court would allow him to seek payment of his fees, since he believes “there has been a multiplication of proceedings here that would have been entirely unnecessary if Mr. Feldman had done what I asked him to do that Sunday night in June.” Ashley Belanger Senior Policy Reporter Ashley Belanger Senior Policy Reporter Ashley is a senior policy reporter for Ars Technica, dedicated to tracking social impacts of emerging policies and new technologies.

The attack scope includes all applications depending on the compromised versions and both developers testing with real credentials and production end-users.” Packages that were infected were: npm (@dydxprotocol/v4-client-js): 3.4.1 1.22.1 1.15.2 1.0.31 PyPI (dydx-v4-client): 1.1.5post1 Perpetual trading, perpetual targeting dYdX is a decentralized derivatives exchange that supports hundreds of markets for “perpetual trading,” or the use of cryptocurrency to bet that the value of a derivative future will rise or fall. Socket said dYdX has processed over $1.5 trillion in trading volume over its lifetime, with an average trading volume of $200 million to $540 million and roughly $175 million in open interest. The exchange provides code libraries that allow third-party apps for trading bots, automated strategies, or backend services, all of which handle mnemonics or private keys for signing. The npm malware embedded a malicious function in the legitimate package. When a seed phrase that underpins wallet security was processed, the function exfiltrated it, along with a fingerprint of the device running the app. The fingerprint allowed the threat actor to correlate stolen credentials to track victims across multiple compromises. The domain receiving the seed was dydx[.]priceoracle[.]site, which mimics the legitimate dYdX service at dydx[.]xyz through typosquatting. The malicious code available on PyPI contained the same credential theft function, although it also implemented a remote access Trojan (RAT) that allowed the execution of new malware on infected systems. The backdoor received commands from dydx[.]priceoracle[.]site. The domain was registered on January 9, 17 days before the malicious package was uploaded to PyPI. The RAT, Socket said: Runs as a background daemon thread Beacons to the C2 server every 10 seconds Receives Python code from the server Executes it in an isolated subprocess with no visible output Uses a hardcoded authorization token: 490CD9DAD3FAE1F59521C27A96B32F5D677DD41BF1F706A0BF85E69CA6EBFE75 Once installed, the threat actors could: Execute arbitrary Python code with user privileges Steal SSH keys, API credentials, and source code Install persistent backdoors Exfiltrate sensitive files Monitor user activity Modify critical files Pivot to other systems on the network Socket said the packages were published to npm and PyPI by official dYdX accounts, an indication that they were compromised and used by the attackers. dYdX officials didn’t respond to an email seeking confirmation and additional details. The incident is at least the third time dYdX has been targeted in attacks. Previous events include a September 2022 uploading of malicious code to the npm repository and the commandeering in 2024 of the dYdX v3 website through DNS hijacking. Users were redirected to a malicious site that prompted them to sign transactions designed to drain their wallets. “Viewed alongside the 2022 npm supply chain compromise and the 2024 DNS hijacking incident, this [latest] attack highlights a persistent pattern of adversaries targeting dYdX-related assets through trusted distribution channels,” Socket said. “The threat actor simultaneously compromised packages in both npm and PyPI ecosystems, expanding the attack surface to reach JavaScript and Python developers working with dYdX.” Anyone using the platform should carefully examine all apps for dependencies on the malicious packages listed above.

Kyle Orland – Feb 6, 2026 4:53 pm | 171 I know my Steam Machine is in here somewhere... Credit: Getty Images I know my Steam Machine is in here somewhere... Credit: Getty Images Text settings Story text Size Small Standard Large Width * Standard Wide Links Standard Orange * Subscribers only Learn more Minimize to nav After writing two November stories analyzing price expectations for Valve’s upcoming Steam Machine, I really didn’t think we’d be offering more informed speculation before the official price was revealed. Then Valve wrote a blog post this week noting that the “growing price of… critical components” like RAM and storage meant that “we must revisit our exact shipping schedule and pricing” for the living room-focused PC gaming box. We don’t know exactly what form that “revisiting” will take at the moment. Analysts who spoke to Ars were somewhat divided on how much of its quickly increasing component costs Valve would be willing (or forced) to pass on to consumers. “We knew the component issue was bad,” DFC Intelligence analyst David Cole told Ars. “It has just gotten worse. “ Starting at $599 to $1,000? How much worse has the pricing situation gotten for Valve since November? Superdata Research founder and SuperJoost newsletter author Joost van Dreunen suggested that the 512GB Steam Machine model would probably run $50 to $75 more than he expected when the Steam Machine was announced, and to expect a price “potentially $100+ above target” for the high-end 2TB model. That would mean a $599 to $629 price at the low-end and $849 to $899 for the high-end model, in his estimation. Wedbush Morgan analyst Michael Pachter agreed that, even with the additional component costs, Valve would likely “try to get it out at $599 or so for the 512GB version,” A starting price higher than that would mean “abysmal” sales, he added. “I think $700 is a death sentence and $1,000 is unsellable.” It costs a lot to look this good. It costs a lot to look this good. Other analysts think that Pachter’s “unsellable” price for the Steam Machine is increasingly plausible now, though. DFC’s Cole said possible prices for the Steam Machine are now “approaching $1,000,” with the 512GB model perhaps $100 less than 2TB model. But F-Squared analyst Michael Futter expected an even bigger gap between the two models, saying the 512GB model “could crest $1,000” and the 2TB model would likely fall somewhere in the $1,300 to $1,500 range. Bad news for Valve in particular? On the surface, it might seem like every company making gaming hardware would be similarly affected by increasing component costs. In practice, though, analysts suggested that Valve might be in a uniquely bad position to absorb this ongoing market disruption. Large console makers like Sony and Microsoft “can commit to tens of millions of orders, and have strong negotiating power,” Niko Partners analyst Daniel Ahmad pointed out. The Steam Machine, on the other hand, is “a niche product that cannot benefit in the same way when it comes to procurement,” meaning Valve has to shoulder higher component cost increases. F-Squared’s Futter echoed that Valve is “not an enormous player in the hardware space, even with the Steam Deck’s success. So they likely don’t have the same kind of priority as a Nintendo, Sony, or Microsoft when it comes to suppliers.” Sony and Microsoft might have an advantage when negotiating volume discounts with suppliers. Credit: Sam Machkovech Sony and Microsoft might have an advantage when negotiating volume discounts with suppliers. Credit: Sam Machkovech The size of the Steam Machine price adjustment also might depend on when Valve made its supply chain commitments. “It’s not clear when or if Valve locked in supply contracts for the Steam Machine, or if supply can be diverted from the Steam Deck for the new product,” Tech Insights analyst James Sanders noted. On the other hand, “Sony and Microsoft likely will have locked in more favorable component pricing before the current spike,” Van Dreunen said. That said, some other aspects of the Steam Machine design could give Valve some greater pricing flexibility. Sanders noted that the Steam Machine’s smaller physical size could mean smaller packaging and reduced shipping costs for Valve. And selling the system primarily through direct sales via the web and Steam itself eliminates the usual retailer markups console makers have to take into account, he added. “I think Valve was hoping for a much lower price and that the component issue would be short-term,” Cole said. “Obviously it is looking more like a long-term issue.” It’s all relative So, if Valve is forced to significantly increase the asking price of the Steam Machine, does that mean significantly fewer people will be willing to buy it? Not necessarily. DFC’s Cole said that this kind of gaming hardware already has “a fairly niche built-in audience that will not be too price sensitive.” Van Dreunen agreed that the Steam Machines’ “core audience, PC gamers who want a living room setup without the hassle of a full build, will absorb a $50 to $100 price increase without much hesitation.” But that core audience might not be very large; Pachter said that, even with a $599 starting price, the Steam Machine would “likely sell no more than 5 million [units].” At a higher starting price, he saw total sales going down quickly. A lot has changed since Valve first introduced the Steam Machine in November. The analysts who spoke to Ars agreed that recent price increases for every major game console gave Valve a little more competitive breathing room regarding pricing. But the relative price difference between Valve and the other console makers will still matter, they said. “While Valve may have been aiming to price its Steam Machine in line with the PS5/Xbox Series X|S at one point, or potentially undercut it, it’s now clear that the company may have to price it above these competitors,” Ahmad said. “At a time when multiple competitors exist on the market, we believe the higher price will limit the audience for the Steam Machine going forward.” Futter agreed that whichever company could offer the lowest-cost machine that could plausibly offer 4K, 60 fps performance in most modern games (as the Steam Machine is targeting) would reap great benefits in the market. But even if the Steam Machine isn’t cheaper than competing high-end consoles, Futter said Valve’s hardware would appeal to those who “want to get into [high-end] PC gaming and can’t absorb $2,500+ for access to the Steam ecosystem.” In the end, how Valve handles Steam Machine pricing might depend on whether the company wants to “expand SteamOS beyond the enthusiast base and into territory currently held by PlayStation and Xbox,” as Van Dreunen put it. “The memory cost shock doesn’t threaten Valve’s ability to sell to its existing audience. It threatens the pace at which it can grow a new one.” Kyle Orland Senior Gaming Editor Kyle Orland Senior Gaming Editor Kyle Orland has been the Senior Gaming Editor at Ars Technica since 2012, writing primarily about the business, tech, and culture behind video games.

Bloomberg writes that these third-party apps won't be able to replace the Siri button in the CarPlay interface or use their own wake words (\"Hey Google,\" etc.). Instead, anyone who wants to spend a long drive talking to Gemini will have to open the app first.

Credit: Education Images Text settings Story text Size Small Standard Large Width * Standard Wide Links Standard Orange * Subscribers only Learn more Minimize to nav In the spring of 2020, as the COVID-19 pandemic brought global industry and travel nearly to a halt, satellite sensors recorded a dramatic plunge in nitrogen dioxide, a byproduct of internal combustion engines and heavy industry. For a moment, the world’s air was cleaner than it had been in decades. But then something strange started happening: methane, the second most important anthropogenic greenhouse gas after carbon dioxide, was surging. Its growth rate hit 16.2 parts per billion that year, the highest since systematic records began in the early 1980s. A new study published in the journal Science looked at the complex chemistry of the troposphere (the lowest region of the atmosphere) and found that the two changes are likely connected. An atmospheric cleaner Since the late 1960s, we knew that atmospheric methane doesn’t just vanish. It is actively scrubbed from the sky by the hydroxyl radical, a highly reactive molecule that breaks down methane, turning it into water vapor and carbon dioxide. “The problem is that the lifetime of the hydroxyl radical is very short—its lifespan is less than a second” says Shushi Peng, a professor at Peking University, China, and a co-author of the study. To do its job as an atmospheric methane clearing agent, a hydroxyl radical must be constantly replenished through a series of chemical reactions triggered by sunlight. The key ingredients in these reactions are nitrogen oxides, the very pollutants that were drastically reduced when cars stayed in garages and factories went dark in 2020. When nitrogen oxide levels plummeted by approximately 15 to 20 percent globally during the 2020 lockdowns, the production of the hydroxyl radical slowed to a crawl. Without enough of these to go around, methane molecules that would have normally been destroyed remained in the atmosphere for longer. Peng and his colleagues estimate that the reduction in this methane sink accounted for approximately 80 percent of the massive spike in the methane growth rate seen in 2020. The cleaner our air became, the longer the methane stuck around to warm the planet. The remaining question, though, was where all this methane was coming from in the first place. Throughout the pandemic, there was speculation that the surge might be caused by super-emitter events in the oil and gas sector, or perhaps a lack of maintenance on leaky infrastructure during lockdowns. But the new research suggests that the source of these emissions was not what many expected. The microbial surge While the weakened atmospheric sink explained the bulk of the 2020 surge, it wasn’t the only factor at play. The remaining 20 percent of the growth, and an even larger portion of the growth in 2021 and 2022, came from an increase in actual emissions from the ground. To track the source of these emissions down, Peng’s team went through tons of data from satellites and various ground monitoring stations. Methane comes in different isotopic signatures. Methane from fossil fuels like natural gas leaks or coal mines is heavier, containing a higher fraction of the stable isotope carbon-13. Conversely, methane produced by microbes found in the guts of livestock, in landfills, and most notably in wetlands, is lighter, enriched in carbon-12. When the researchers analyzed data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration global flask network, a worldwide monitoring system tracking the chemical composition of Earth’s atmosphere, they found that the atmospheric methane during the mysterious surge was becoming significantly lighter. This was a smoking gun for biogenic sources. The surge wasn’t coming from pipes or power plants; it was coming from microbes. La Niña came to play The timing of the pandemic coincided with a relatively rare meteorological event. La Niña, the cool phase of the El Niño–Southern Oscillation that typically leads to increased rainfall in the tropics, lasted for three consecutive Northern Hemisphere winters (from 2020 to 2023). This made the early 2020s exceptionally wet. The researchers used satellite data from the Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite and sophisticated atmospheric models to trace the source of the light methane to vast wetland areas in tropical Africa and Southeast Asia. In regions like the Sudd in South Sudan and the Congo Basin, record-breaking rainfall flooded massive swaths of land. In these waterlogged, oxygen-poor environments, microbial methanogens thrived, churning out methane at an accelerated pace. Peng and his team found that tropical African and Asian wetlands alone were responsible for roughly 30 percent of the global methane emissions increase during the 2020–2022 period. The clean air paradox Methane is often touted as the low-hanging fruit of climate policy because it has a shorter atmospheric lifetime than carbon dioxide. For a long time, we thought that if we stopped the infrastructure leaks and other methane emissions today, the atmosphere would clear relatively quickly. But the study done by Peng and his colleagues shows that things might not be that simple. There are two major challenges we must face to solve the methane problem, and both are largely outside of direct human control. First, there is the threat of climate feedbacks. If warming temperatures and changing precipitation patterns cause a boost in natural wetland emissions, we may find ourselves in a race against a biological source that we cannot simply turn off. The second challenge, arguably even harder to overcome, is the clean air paradox that emerges from the results of Peng’s study. As we transition away from fossil fuels and improve urban air quality, nitrogen oxide levels will naturally decline—an unequivocal win for public health. But the atmosphere’s natural capacity to scrub methane will also decline. That’s a piece of science that’s almost sure to get hopelessly distorted in our maelstrom of conflicting politics. Because it means all the coal power plants, V8 cars, and private jets actually purge a greenhouse gas out of the atmosphere, right? “Not really, because everyone needs clean air,” argues Peng. “It means that we must reduce anthropogenic methane emissions.” If it’s just to compensate for a cleaner atmosphere with less hydroxyl radicals, we’re likely going to need even more aggressive reductions than we previously thought. “I think that’s the only choice for the policy makers,” Peng adds.

Waymo touts more than 200 million miles of driving that informs how the vehicles navigate roads, but the company’s AI has also driven billions of miles virtually, and there’s a lot more to come with the new Waymo World Model. Based on Google DeepMind’s Genie 3, Waymo says the model can create “hyper-realistic” simulated environments that train the AI on situations that are rarely (or never) encountered in real life—like snow on the Golden Gate Bridge. Until recently, the autonomous driving industry relied entirely on training data collected from real cars and real situations. That means rare, potentially dangerous events are not well represented in training data. The Waymo World Model aims to address that by allowing engineers to create simulations with simple prompts and driving inputs. Google revealed Genie 3 last year, positioning it as a significant upgrade over other world models by virtue of its long-horizon memory. In Google’s world model, you can wander away from a given object, and when you look back, the model will still “remember” how that object is supposed to look. In earlier attempts at world models, the simulation would lose that context almost immediately. With Genie 3, the model can remember details for several minutes. Snow in San Francisco. Snow in San Francisco. Autoregressive world models like Genie don’t actually create 3D spaces, but instead render video quickly enough that it feels like an explorable world. Naturally, video games are cited as a prime application for world models, so much so that gaming company stocks dropped when Google recently expanded access to the technology as Project Genie. However, the latency and still rather short memory of Genie make gaming uses far from a certainty. Nevertheless, Waymo says Genie 3 is actually ideal for simulating the kind of data it needs to train self-driving cars. On the road with AI The Waymo World Model is not just a straight port of Genie 3 with dashcam videos stuffed inside. Waymo and DeepMind used a specialized post-training process to make the new model generate both 2D video and 3D lidar outputs of the same scene. While cameras are great for visualizing fine details, Waymo says lidar is necessary to add critical depth information to what a self-driving car “sees” on the road—maybe someone should tell Tesla about that. Using a world model allows Waymo to take video from its vehicles and use prompts to change the route the vehicle takes, which it calls driving action control. These simulations, which come with lidar maps, reportedly offer greater realism and consistency than older reconstructive simulation methods. With the world model, Waymo can see what would happen if the car took a different turn. With the world model, Waymo can see what would happen if the car took a different turn. This model can also help improve the self-driving AI even without adding or removing everything. There are plenty of dashcam videos available for training self-driving vehicles, but they lack the multimodal sensor data of Waymo’s vehicles. Dropping such a video into the Waymo World Model generates matching sensor data, showing how the driving AI would have seen that situation. While the Waymo World Model can create entirely synthetic scenes, the company seems mostly interested in “mutating” the conditions in real videos. The blog post contains examples of changing the time of day or weather, adding new signage, or placing vehicles in unusual places. Or, hey, why not an elephant in the road? Waymo is ready in case an elephant shows up. Waymo is ready in case an elephant shows up. Waymo’s early test cities were consistently sunny (like Phoenix) with little inclement weather. These kinds of simulations could help the cars adapt to other environments. The new markets include places with more difficult conditions, including Boston and Washington, D.C. Of course, the benefit of the new AI model will depend on how accurately Genie 3 can simulate the real world. The test videos we’ve seen of Genie 3 run the gamut from pretty believable to uncanny valley territory, but Waymo believes the technology has improved to the point that it can teach self-driving cars a thing or two.

    "summary": "Disney+ subscribers in some European countries have lost access to advanced HDR features like Dolby Vision, TechRadar and FlatpanelsHD report. The issue was first spotted by German Disney+ subscribers on Reddit, but currently also impacts subscribers in Portugal, Poland, France and the Netherlands, according to FlatpanelsHD.\n\"Dolby Vision support for content on Disney+ is currently unavailable in several European countries due to technical challenges,\" Disney said in a statement. \"We are actively working to restore access to Dolby Vision and will provide an update as soon as possible. 4K UHD and HDR support remain available on supported devices.\"\nIf the issue is in fact a technical one, it seems like it could be around for the long-term. Disney has removed any reference to Dolby Vision from its Disney+ video quality support page in Germany. As of now, the company lists HDR10 as its default HDR format, despite Dolby Vision support being a feature of Disney+ for several years now. \nFlatpanelsHD writes that the real issue might be legal, rather than technological. A company called InterDigital won an injunction in a German court against Disney in November 2025 because it violated at least one of the company's patents on streaming video technology. The injunction specifically requires Disney to stop violating InterDigital's patent on \"a method for dynamically overlaying a first video stream with a second video stream comprising, for example, subtitles.\" It's not entirely clear how that plays into the company offering Dolby Vision in Europe, but it would explain why subscribers in Germany were some of the first people to notice Dolby Vision's absence.\nEngadget has contacted Disney for more information about Disney+'s missing HDR support and whether InterDigital's injunction played a role. We'll update this article if we hear back.\nMentions of Dolby Vision were also stripped out of the US version of Disney+'s video quality support page. InterDigital hasn't won an injunction in the US, but the company is pursuing a patent case against Disney in the United States District Court for the Central District of California.

Credit: Blue Origin Text settings Story text Size Small Standard Large Width * Standard Wide Links Standard Orange * Subscribers only Learn more Minimize to nav Engineers at Blue Origin have been grappling with a seemingly eternal debate that involves the New Glenn rocket and the economics of flying it. The debate goes back at least 15 years, to the early discussions around the design of the heavy lift rocket. The first stage, of course, would be fully reusable. But what about the upper stage of New Glenn, powered by two large BE-3U engines? Around the same time, in the early 2010s, SpaceX was also trading the economics of reusing the second stage of its Falcon 9 rocket. Eventually SpaceX founder Elon Musk abandoned his goal of a fully reusable Falcon 9, choosing instead to recover payload fairings and push down manufacturing costs of the upper stage as much as possible. This strategy worked, as SpaceX has lowered its internal launch costs of a Falcon 9, even with a new second stage, to about $15 million. The company is now focused on making the larger Starship rocket fully reusable. New Glenn is quite a bit larger than the Falcon 9 vehicle, 98 meters in height compared to 70 meters, and with a 7-meter diameter compared to the Falcon 9’s 3.7 meters; but it is also smaller than Starship. Accordingly Blue Origin has struggled with whether to reuse the New Glenn upper stage or to seek to ruthlessly cut its manufacturing costs. Ebbs and flows of the debate Over the years, this internal debate has waxed and waned. A little more than five years ago, Blue Origin kicked off a project to develop a reusable stainless-steel upper stage known as “Project Jarvis.” This initiative was later abandoned. In the run-up to the first launch of New Glenn in early 2025, both the company’s founder, Jeff Bezos, and CEO, Dave Limp, told Ars in an interview that they were continuing to trade the options on New Glenn’s upper stage, known as GS2. However, a new job posting suggests the debate may be swinging back toward reusing GS2. The job, for a director of “Reusable Upper Stage Development,” was posted Thursday by the company. “As the Director of Program Management for the New Glenn Upper Stage and Payload Accommodations (GS2PA), you will work with the Vice President of New Glenn GS2PA and directly support the execution of a lean engineering initiative to incrementally develop a reusable upper stage,” the job description states. The salary range goes up to $284,430.30. New Glenn is an exceptional rocket, flying expertly on its debut in January 2025, and then shocking the aerospace world (in a good way) by making a stunning first stage landing at sea on just its second flight in November 2025. But this performance comes at a cost. Second stage is costly right now The first generation of the rocket is overengineered and very expensive. Although Ars does not have access to Blue Origin’s internal costs, sources have reliably indicated that it costs in excess of $100 million to manufacture a first stage and more than $50 million to build an upper stage. The first stage cost can be amortized over multiple launches, and that’s precisely what Blue Origin plans to do with the vehicle’s third launch, which will reuse the first stage that landed in November. However, flying super-expensive upper stages is no way to build a sustainable launch business. Right now, Blue Origin has the capacity to build a dozen second stages a year, and it is bringing a new facility online to manufacture more. Presumably, it will be able to shave some costs with rate manufacturing and a simpler second stage design. But this will have limits. The problem gets even worse with the planned upgrade to New Glenn, the 9×4 version of the rocket that will use four BE-3U engines. Such an upper stage probably will cost on the order of $100 million to manufacture. Hence the pressure on Blue Origin to find a pathway to reuse. The challenge is that reusing the upper stages of rockets is still something of an unknown. SpaceX is still experimenting with thermal protection for its Starship vehicle’s return from orbital velocities, and there will be a performance hit for propellant and landing gear mass. So the new director of upper stage development has their work cut out for them.

I’d come across it in a magazine, and then earnestly set about training teams of creatures, transferring them between my Pokémon Red Game Boy cartridge and the 3D arenas of Pokémon Stadium on the Nintendo 64. I never made it as a player but I did finally achieve this dream on my 26th birthday, when I went to Washington DC to cover the world championships as a journalist. I was deeply moved. Presided over by a giant inflatable Pikachu hanging from the ceiling, the competitors and spectators were united in an unselfconscious love for these games, with their colourful menageries and heartfelt messaging about trust, friendship and hard work.\nIt is emotional to see the winners lift their trophies after a tense final round of battles, as overwhelmed by their success as any sportsperson. But it’s the pride that the smaller competitors’ parents show in their mini champions that really gets to me. During the first wave of Pokémania in the late 90s, Pokémon was viewed with suspicion by most adults.

    "summary": "Three weeks ago, I tested something that completely changed how I think about organic traffic. I opened ChatGPT and asked a simple question: \"What's the best course on building SaaS with WordPress?\" The answer that appeared stopped me cold. My course showed up as the first result, recommended directly by the AI with specific reasons why it was valuable.\nI hadn't paid for advertising. I hadn't done any special promotion. The AI simply decided my content was the best answer to that question and served it to the user. This wasn't luck or a fluke. When I tested the same query in Perplexity, the same thing happened. My website ranked at the top of AI-generated responses, pulling in free traffic directly from AI models that millions of people now use as their primary search tool.\nThis represents a fundamental shift in how people discover content online. For years, we've optimized for Google's algorithm, carefully crafting meta descriptions and building backlinks to climb traditional search rankings. That work still matters, but a massive new traffic source has emerged that most content creators are completely ignoring. While everyone focuses exclusively on traditional SEO, AI Optimization is quietly becoming one of the most valuable skills for anyone who publishes content online.\nThe opportunity is enormous right now precisely because it's so new. Early adopters are claiming top positions in AI responses while their competitors remain oblivious to this emerging channel. But this window won't stay open forever. As more people recognize the value of appearing in AI results, competition will increase and optimization will become more sophisticated. The time to understand and implement AIO strategies is now, while the landscape is still relatively uncrowded.\nIn this comprehensive guide, I'll show you exactly how AI Optimization works, how it differs from traditional SEO, what specific tactics actually move the needle, and how to track your performance so you know what's working. More importantly, I'll explain why you can't afford to ignore this traffic source if you want to remain visible online as user behavior continues shifting toward AI-powered search.\nUnderstanding the Fundamental Shift in Search Behavior\nSomething profound has changed in how people find information online, and most website owners haven't noticed yet. The change isn't about a new Google algorithm update or a shift in social media platforms. It's about where people go when they have questions that need answering.\nFor twenty years, the pattern was predictable and universal. Someone needs information, they open Google, they type a query, they scan through ten blue links, they click a few results, they piece together answers from multiple sources. This process trained us to optimize for that journey. We focused on ranking in those ten blue links because that's where traffic came from. The entire SEO industry built around understanding and exploiting that single funnel.\nBut look at what's happening now. Someone needs information, they open ChatGPT or Claude or Perplexity, they ask a question in natural language, they receive a comprehensive answer immediately with sources cited. No clicking through multiple websites. No comparing different perspectives. No scanning search results pages. The AI synthesizes information and delivers a direct answer, fundamentally changing the discovery process.\nThe numbers tell the story. ChatGPT reached 100 million users faster than any consumer application in history, hitting that milestone in just two months after launch. By early 2025, ChatGPT alone processes over 10 million queries daily through its web browsing feature. Perplexity has grown to millions of daily users who rely on it as their primary search tool. Google has responded by launching AI Mode, available in over 180 countries, which provides AI-generated answers above traditional search results.\nThese aren't niche tools used by tech enthusiasts. They're mainstream applications that everyday people now use for research, planning, learning, and decision-making. When someone searches for \"best productivity apps for small teams,\" they're increasingly likely to ask an AI rather than Google. When a business owner needs to understand a technical topic, they're prompting Claude instead of reading blog posts. When students research topics for papers, they're querying Perplexity instead of clicking through search results.\nThis behavioral shift creates a new visibility challenge. Your content might rank perfectly on Google, but if it's invisible to AI models when they're formulating answers, you're missing an enormous and growing segment of potential traffic. The users who discover information through AI tools never even see your traditional search rankings because they never visit a search results page.\nThe problem compounds because AI search is still in its explosive growth phase. Usage is doubling and tripling year over year as more people discover these tools and integrate them into their daily workflows. The traffic opportunity today is significant, but it's tiny compared to what it will become in the next few years as AI search becomes default behavior for entire demographics.\nWhat AIO Actually Means and Why It Matters\nAIO stands for AI Optimization, and it represents the practice of optimizing your content to appear in AI-generated responses when people query language models. Think of it as SEO's younger sibling, similar in purpose but different in execution because the underlying mechanisms for how AI models select and cite sources differ fundamentally from how Google ranks web pages.\nTraditional SEO focuses on signals that Google's algorithms evaluate when determining search rankings. You optimize title tags and meta descriptions. You build backlinks from authoritative sites. You ensure your site loads quickly and works on mobile devices. You create content that targets specific keywords with appropriate density and placement. These tactics work because they align with how Google's systems assess page quality and relevance.\nAIO requires understanding how language models decide which sources to reference when answering questions. These models don't follow the same rules as search engine algorithms. They're not counting backlinks or analyzing page load speed. They're evaluating whether content provides clear, accurate, comprehensive answers to questions people actually ask. They're assessing credibility through different signals than traditional search engines use. They're making probabilistic decisions about which information best satisfies a query based on patterns learned during training and information retrieved during real-time web searches.\nThe distinction matters because tactics that boost Google rankings don't automatically improve your chances of being cited by AI models, and vice versa. A page optimized perfectly for SEO might never appear in AI responses if it doesn't align with how language models evaluate content. Conversely, content that AI models consistently cite might not rank highly in traditional search if it lacks conventional SEO signals.\nThis doesn't mean you should abandon SEO and focus exclusively on AIO. The two approaches are complementary, not competing. People still use Google extensively, and traditional search traffic remains valuable. The point is that comprehensive visibility requires optimizing for both channels. You need your content discoverable through conventional search engines and reliably cited by AI models. This dual approach captures traffic from users regardless of which discovery method they prefer.\nThe strategic value of AIO extends beyond just additional traffic. When an AI model cites your content, it provides context explaining why your resource is valuable. The model doesn't just list your URL like a search result—it summarizes your key points, extracts relevant information, and positions your content as a trusted source. This creates a stronger credibility signal than a traditional search result because the AI has effectively pre-vetted your content and endorsed it as worth reading.\nThink about the user experience difference. In traditional search, someone sees your site listed among ten results and must decide whether to click based on a title and two-line description. In AI search, someone reads an answer that includes information from your content, sees your site cited as the source, and arrives at your page already understanding its value and relevance. The qualification happens before the click, resulting in higher-quality traffic with better engagement metrics.\nGoogle AI Mode and the Future of Search\nGoogle's introduction of AI Mode represents a pivotal moment in search engine evolution and confirms that AI-generated answers are becoming a core component of how major platforms deliver information. Understanding this development helps contextualize why AIO matters and where organic discovery is headed.\nAI Mode transforms Google's interface from a list of links into a conversational AI that provides direct answers. When you access AI Mode (available at google.com/ai or through the Google app), you interact with a language model that searches the web in real-time and synthesizes comprehensive responses to your questions. Instead of scanning through multiple websites, you receive curated information with sources cited, similar to ChatGPT with web search or Perplexity.\nWhat makes this particularly significant is Google's market position. Despite the rise of alternative AI search tools, Google still processes billions of searches daily and serves as the primary discovery mechanism for most internet users. When Google integrates AI-generated answers into its core search experience, it's not experimenting with a niche feature—it's fundamentally changing how the world's most popular search engine works.\nThe financial implications validate this direction. Google reported that AI features contributed to a 10% increase in search revenue, reaching $50.7 billion in Q1 2025. This isn't a failing experiment that might be discontinued. It's a successful product innovation that's generating substantial revenue while improving user experience. Google has every incentive to expand AI Mode and integrate its capabilities more deeply into standard search.\nCurrently, AI Mode exists as a separate interface that users must access intentionally, but the trajectory is clear. Google has indicated that AI-generated answers will eventually become a more prominent part of standard search results. While they've walked back statements about making AI Mode the default search experience after initial concerns, the long-term direction remains toward greater AI integration. Traditional search results won't disappear, but AI-generated summaries will occupy increasingly valuable real estate on search result pages.\nThis evolution mirrors what happened with featured snippets and knowledge panels over the past decade. Google gradually introduced elements that answered questions directly on the search page rather than requiring clicks to external sites. AI Mode represents the next iteration of this trend—more comprehensive answers, synthesized from multiple sources, delivered conversationally rather than as extracted snippets.\nFor content creators, this creates both opportunities and challenges. The opportunity is that appearing in AI-generated responses places your content in a prominent, trusted position that provides context and drives qualified traffic. The challenge is that optimization strategies must adapt to capture this visibility. Content that ranks well in traditional search results won't automatically appear in AI Mode responses without deliberate optimization for how AI systems evaluate and select sources.\nThe global availability of AI Mode in over 180 countries means this isn't a gradual rollout that you can monitor and prepare for leisurely. It's happening now, and users worldwide are already accessing AI-powered search. Your competitors might be optimizing for these systems while you're still focused exclusively on traditional SEO, giving them an advantage in capturing traffic from this rapidly growing segment.\nHow to Track Your AIO Performance\nOne of the biggest challenges with AI Optimization is measurement. Traditional SEO provides robust analytics through Google Search Console, showing exactly which queries trigger impressions, how often people click your results, and where you rank for specific keywords. These metrics make it straightforward to track SEO progress and identify opportunities for improvement.\nAIO lacks this infrastructure. ChatGPT doesn't provide website owners with analytics showing how often their content appears in responses. Perplexity doesn't send performance reports. Google AI Mode doesn't have a Search Console equivalent yet. This creates a visibility problem—you can't optimize what you can't measure.\nSeveral commercial tools have emerged to fill this gap, offering AIO tracking and monitoring services. Ahrefs introduced features for tracking AI visibility at $129 per month. SE Ranking offers similar capabilities starting at $95 monthly. First Answer provides specialized AIO tracking for $39 per month but limits you to just 10 query tests. Keyword.com offers competitive pricing with various tier options.\nThese tools work by systematically querying AI models with specific prompts and analyzing which sources appear in the responses. They help you understand whether your content shows up for relevant queries, how you compare to competitors, and how your visibility changes over time. For businesses with substantial budgets, these professional tools provide valuable insights with minimal setup effort.\nHowever, the pricing creates barriers for smaller website owners, bloggers, and businesses just beginning to explore AIO. Spending $100-300 monthly on tracking tools makes sense when you're generating significant revenue from AI traffic, but it's prohibitive when you're still validating whether AIO is worth your investment. This gap between professional tools and budget-conscious creators leaves many people flying blind with no way to measure their AIO performance.\nThe solution is building your own tracking system using no-code automation tools. This approach requires more initial setup but provides ongoing monitoring at a fraction of commercial tool costs. The system I built uses Make.com, a no-code automation platform, to query AI models systematically, analyze responses, and track mentions over time. Make offers 1,000 operations monthly on their free tier, making it possible to start tracking without any monetary investment.\nThe tracking system consists of three automated scenarios that work together to provide comprehensive AIO monitoring. The first scenario handles query tracking and brand mentions, automatically sending prompts to ChatGPT and recording which sources appear in responses. The second scenario performs keyword performance analysis, tracking specific topics or phrases relevant to your business and monitoring whether you're gaining or losing visibility. The third scenario focuses on competitor tracking, identifying when competitors appear in AI responses and analyzing their positioning compared to yours.\nBuilding this system requires understanding of Make.com's interface and basic automation concepts, but it's accessible to anyone willing to invest a few hours in setup. The difficulty level sits at intermediate—more complex than basic automation but far simpler than custom programming. Once configured, the system runs automatically on whatever schedule you set, collecting data and building a historical record of your AIO performance.\nThe workflow begins with identifying the queries you want to track. These are essentially \"AIO keywords\"—questions that people might ask AI models where your content should ideally appear in the answer. Unlike traditional SEO keywords, which are often short phrases, AIO queries tend to be longer, more conversational questions that reflect how people actually talk to AI assistants.\nFor example, instead of targeting the SEO keyword \"WordPress hosting,\" you'd track the AIO query \"What's the best WordPress hosting for SaaS applications?\" or \"Which hosting provider should I choose for a WordPress-based business site?\" These natural language questions better represent how people interact with AI tools and help you optimize for actual usage patterns rather than keyword variations.\nFinding these queries requires a different research approach than traditional keyword research. Rather than using tools that show search volume and competition metrics, you need to understand what questions your target audience actually asks AI models. This means thinking about their problems, concerns, and information needs, then formulating those as conversational queries. Tools like an LLM Query Generator can help by analyzing your content and suggesting relevant questions people might ask to find that information.\nOnce you've identified target queries, the automated system tests them periodically—daily, weekly, or on whatever schedule makes sense for your monitoring needs. Each test queries the AI model with your specified prompt, captures the response, parses which sources were cited, and records whether your content appeared. Over time, this builds a database showing your visibility trends, how often competitors appear for the same queries, and which topics you're gaining or losing ground on.\nThe data collected enables strategic decisions about content creation and optimization. If certain queries consistently show competitor sources but never yours, that signals an opportunity to create or improve content addressing that topic. If you're appearing reliably for some questions but not others in the same category, you can analyze what makes your successful content different and apply those lessons to underperforming pieces. If your visibility is declining over time, you know you need to refresh and strengthen your content to maintain AI citation rates.\nThis measurement foundation transforms AIO from guesswork into a data-driven practice. Instead of optimizing blindly and hoping AI models notice, you track actual performance and refine your approach based on concrete results. The initial investment in building or subscribing to tracking tools pays dividends through improved optimization efficiency and clearer understanding of what tactics actually work for your specific content and audience.\nThe Seven Proven Tactics That Actually Work\nUnderstanding AIO conceptually is valuable, but implementation requires specific, actionable tactics that demonstrably improve your chances of appearing in AI-generated responses. These seven strategies have proven effective across different content types, industries, and AI platforms. They work because they align with how language models evaluate sources and decide which content to cite when formulating answers.\nThe first tactic centers on incorporating statistics, numbers, and verifiable proof throughout your content. AI models exhibit a strong preference for factual, data-backed information over general statements or opinions. When a model encounters two sources covering the same topic, one making vague claims and another providing specific numbers with citations, the statistical content almost always wins.\nThis doesn't mean stuffing your content with random numbers. It means grounding your claims in specific, verifiable data wherever possible. Instead of writing \"Our tool is widely used,\" you'd write \"Our tool has 150,000 monthly active users with a 4.7 out of 5 satisfaction rating based on 3,200 reviews.\" The specificity signals credibility to AI models, which learned during training that precise data indicates reliable sources.\nThe same principle applies to any factual claim. When discussing market trends, cite specific growth percentages and time periods. When mentioning company performance, include actual revenue figures or user counts. When describing product features, provide concrete specifications rather than abstract descriptions. Each piece of specific data you add increases the likelihood that AI models will view your content as authoritative and citation-worthy.\nThis approach requires sourcing and maintaining accurate information, which means you can't fabricate numbers or exaggerate metrics. AI models increasingly cross-reference claims across sources, and inconsistencies damage credibility. The data you include must be truthful and, where relevant, attributed to primary sources. But when you consistently provide specific, accurate information, you build a reputation as a reliable source that AI models return to repeatedly.\nThe second tactic involves active engagement on Reddit, Quora, and similar community forums. This strategy works for a less obvious reason than you might expect. It's not primarily about direct traffic from forum posts, though that can be valuable. It's about creating authentic mentions and discussions of your content across platforms that AI models frequently encounter during training and web searches.\nLanguage models learn from vast datasets that include substantial amounts of community discussion content. Reddit threads, Quora answers, and forum posts represent genuine human conversations about real topics, making them high-value training data. When your content or expertise appears naturally in these discussions, it creates signals that AI models recognize and incorporate into their understanding of what resources exist and who's knowledgeable about specific topics.\nThe key word here is \"naturally.\" AI models have learned to recognize and discount obvious spam, self-promotion, and link-dropping. Simply posting your URL in relevant threads won't help and might actually hurt if it generates negative reactions or gets flagged as spam. Instead, you need to participate genuinely in communities where your expertise is relevant, providing real value in discussions and mentioning your content only when it truly addresses someone's question or adds to the conversation.\nThis means answering questions thoroughly, sharing insights from your experience, helping solve problems, and building a reputation as a knowledgeable contributor before you ever share links. When you do reference your content, it should be in the context of \"I wrote a detailed guide about exactly this problem that covers X, Y, and Z\" rather than \"Check out my site.\" The former contributes to the discussion while the latter feels promotional.\nOver time, this authentic participation creates a distributed network of references to your expertise and content across platforms that AI models access. These organic mentions, especially when they're accompanied by positive community response, signal that you're a legitimate authority worth citing. The impact accumulates gradually but compounds over months as you build a presence in relevant communities.\nThe third tactic focuses on optimizing for natural language queries rather than keyword stuffing. Traditional SEO often encourages optimizing for specific keyword phrases, sometimes at the expense of natural writing. You might structure sentences awkwardly to include exact keyword matches or repeat phrases more often than sounds natural. This approach can work for search engines that match keywords mechanically.\nAI models process language differently. They understand semantic meaning and context, not just keyword matching. When people query AI tools, they ask complete questions in conversational language: \"What's the best WordPress hosting for SaaS applications?\" rather than \"WordPress hosting SaaS.\" Your content needs to answer these natural questions directly and comprehensively to appear in AI responses.\nThis means structuring your content around questions your audience actually asks. Include FAQ sections that address common queries in full-sentence question format. Write subheadings as questions rather than just topics. Provide complete answers that someone could understand without additional context. Make your content readable and helpful to humans first, trusting that AI models will recognize and value that quality.\nThe practical implementation involves thinking about the conversation your audience wants to have rather than the keywords they might type. What are they trying to accomplish? What confuses them? What decisions are they facing? What objections or concerns do they have? When you address these elements in natural, conversational language, you simultaneously create content that people find valuable and that AI models recognize as comprehensive answers to common questions.\nThe fourth tactic requires creating comparison tables and structured data that AI models can easily parse and reference. Language models excel at processing structured information organized in clear, consistent formats. When they encounter well-formatted comparison tables, step-by-step lists, or data organized in predictable structures, they can extract and cite that information more reliably than when similar content appears in dense paragraphs.\nThis doesn't mean every piece of content should become a table or list. It means that when you're presenting information that naturally fits structured formats—comparisons between options, sequential steps in a process, multiple examples of a concept, sets of tips or recommendations—you should use formatting that makes that structure explicit and easy to process.\nFor example, if you're comparing different software tools, create an actual comparison table with columns for features, pricing, pros, and cons rather than describing each tool in paragraph form. If you're explaining a multi-step process, number the steps and use consistent formatting for each. If you're providing examples, use a predictable structure where each example follows the same pattern.\nThe benefit extends beyond AI optimization. Structured content is easier for human readers to scan and comprehend too. People increasingly skim content rather than reading every word, and clear structure helps them extract key information quickly. When you optimize for both AI processing and human scanning through better structure, you improve the experience for all visitors while increasing AI citation rates.\nImplementation requires evaluating your existing content and identifying opportunities to add structure without forcing it artificially. Look for places where you're listing multiple items in prose that would be clearer as bullet points. Find sections comparing options that would benefit from table format. Identify processes that could be broken into numbered steps. These changes often improve content quality while making it more AI-friendly.\nThe fifth tactic involves building multi-platform authority by publishing consistent information across different channels. AI models, particularly those with web search capabilities, often cross-reference information across sources to verify accuracy and assess credibility. When they find the same core information presented consistently on your website, in your social media content, in articles you've published elsewhere, and in your responses on community platforms, it signals that you're a legitimate authority on that topic.\nThis doesn't mean duplicating content identically across platforms, which could create SEO problems and doesn't align with best practices for different mediums. It means maintaining consistent expertise, perspectives, and factual information while adapting the format and style to each platform's norms and audience expectations.\nYour core message and expertise should be recognizable across a blog post on your website, a LinkedIn article, a Twitter thread, a YouTube video description, and a guest post on another site. The specific examples might vary, and the depth of coverage will differ based on format constraints, but the fundamental information should align. This consistency reinforces your authority and makes it easier for AI models to identify you as a reliable source on specific topics.\nBuilding this multi-platform presence takes time and consistent effort. You can't create authority across channels overnight, but you can develop a systematic approach to repurposing and adapting your best content for different platforms. Each piece of substantial content you create should have a distribution plan that gets the core insights in front of audiences across multiple channels over time.\nThe strategic value compounds as your presence grows. Early on, you might only appear in AI responses when the model happens to encounter your website. As you build presence across platforms, the model has multiple opportunities to encounter your expertise from different angles, increasing the likelihood that it recognizes you as an authority worth citing.\nThe sixth tactic emphasizes showing fresh update signals throughout your content. AI models, especially those with real-time web access, demonstrate preference for current information over dated content. When choosing between two sources covering the same topic, with one clearly recent and another older, the fresher content usually gets cited unless there's a compelling reason to reference historical information.\nThis creates both an opportunity and a maintenance requirement. The opportunity is that regularly updating content can improve AI citation rates even if the core information hasn't changed dramatically. The requirement is that high-performing content needs periodic refreshes to maintain its competitive position as newer articles on the same topics emerge.\nMaking freshness obvious requires explicit signals that AI models can easily detect. The most straightforward approach is including \"Last updated: [Date]\" at the top of articles, making it immediately clear that the content reflects current information. This simple addition can significantly impact whether AI models view your content as relevant for queries about current state or recent developments.\nBeyond update dates, freshness signals include referencing recent events, citing current statistics and data, mentioning the current year in context where relevant, and updating examples to reflect current tools and practices. These signals reassure both AI models and human readers that the information hasn't become outdated even if the core topic is relatively stable.\nThe practical challenge is balancing the benefit of updates against the time investment required. You can't refresh every piece of content constantly, so prioritize based on importance and competitive pressure. Content that generates significant traffic or ranks well in AI responses deserves regular attention to maintain those positions. Content about rapidly changing topics needs more frequent updates than evergreen material. Content facing new competition from recently published articles needs refreshing to remain competitive.\nImplementing a content refresh schedule helps manage this systematically. Rather than updating randomly when you remember, establish a process where high-value content gets reviewed quarterly or semi-annually. During these reviews, update statistics, add recent examples, remove dated references, and add the new update date. This structured approach ensures your most important content remains fresh without requiring constant attention to every article.\nThe seventh tactic involves implementing JSON-LD structured data markup on your web pages. This technical optimization helps AI models understand your content's structure and purpose by providing machine-readable information about what your page contains, what type of content it is, and how different elements relate to each other.\nStructured data uses a standardized format called Schema.org vocabulary implemented through JSON-LD script tags. These tags don't affect how your content appears to human visitors, but they provide clear signals to automated systems parsing your pages, including AI models determining whether your content answers specific queries.\nCommon structured data types relevant for most content include Article (marking blog posts and articles), HowTo (for step-by-step guides), FAQ (for question-and-answer sections), Person (for author bios), Organization (for company information), and Product (for product pages). Implementing appropriate schema markup for your content type helps AI models categorize and understand your content more accurately.\nThe technical implementation requires adding JSON-LD scripts to your page HTML, typically in the header section. Many content management systems, including WordPress, offer plugins that generate this markup automatically based on your content, eliminating the need for manual coding. For custom implementations, Schema.org provides documentation and examples for each data type.\nWhile structured data implementation requires more technical knowledge than the other tactics, its value extends beyond AIO. Search engines like Google also use structured data to create enhanced search results like rich snippets, knowledge panels, and featured answers. This means the optimization work benefits both traditional SEO and AI visibility simultaneously.\nThe cumulative effect of implementing all seven tactics is substantial. Each strategy individually improves your chances of appearing in AI responses, but they work synergistically when combined. Content that includes specific statistics, appears in community discussions, answers natural language questions directly, presents information in structured formats, exists consistently across platforms, shows clear freshness signals, and implements proper schema markup sends multiple reinforcing signals that AI models recognize and value.\nBuilding a Sustainable AIO Strategy\nUnderstanding individual tactics is important, but sustainable success requires integrating AIO into your overall content strategy rather than treating it as a separate, occasional activity. This means developing systematic approaches that maintain and improve your AI visibility over time without requiring constant manual intervention.\nThe foundation of any sustainable strategy is creating content with AIO in mind from the beginning rather than retrofitting optimization after publication. This doesn't mean abandoning your audience's needs to serve AI algorithms—it means recognizing that content optimized for AI models is typically also better for human readers because both value clarity, structure, accuracy, and comprehensiveness.\nWhen planning new content, start by identifying the questions your target audience asks AI models about your topic. These questions form the backbone of your content structure. If you're writing about project management tools, for example, you'd want to address questions like \"What's the best project management software for small teams?\", \"How much do project management tools typically cost?\", and \"What features should I look for in project management software?\" Each of these questions likely deserves a dedicated section with a clear, direct answer.\nYour content outline should reflect these natural queries in your subheadings and section structure. This organizational approach simultaneously improves readability for humans scanning your content and makes it easier for AI models to identify which sections answer specific questions. When someone asks an AI about project management tool features, a model searching your content can quickly locate and cite the relevant section because you've structured it logically around that question.\nThe next consideration is information density and specificity. AI models favor content that provides concrete, actionable information over vague generalizations or superficial coverage. This means investing in depth rather than breadth for your most important topics. A comprehensive 3,000-word guide that thoroughly addresses a topic will typically perform better in AI citations than ten shallow 300-word articles that skim the surface.\nThis depth requirement influences content strategy decisions about volume versus quality. Rather than publishing something new every day with minimal research, you might publish twice weekly but ensure each piece provides genuine value with proper research, specific examples, and comprehensive coverage. The quality-focused approach generates better long-term results both for human audiences and AI visibility.\nMaintenance and updates become critical components of sustainable strategy. AI models accessing the web in real-time naturally favor fresh content, so static articles gradually lose visibility even if they were initially successful. Building systematic content review and refresh processes prevents this decay and maintains your competitive position.\nA practical maintenance schedule might review your top-performing content quarterly, your mid-tier content semi-annually, and your long-tail content annually. During these reviews, you update statistics and examples, add new sections covering recent developments, remove or update outdated information, and add a new \"last updated\" date to signal freshness. This regular maintenance keeps your content competitive and shows both AI models and human visitors that you're actively maintaining accuracy.\nCompetitive analysis should inform your ongoing strategy. Monitor which sources AI models cite for queries where you want visibility. Analyze what makes those sources effective—is it their structure? Their level of detail? Their use of data and statistics? Their freshness? Understanding your competition's strengths helps you identify gaps in your own content and opportunities to differentiate through superior quality or unique angles.\nThis competitive intelligence doesn't mean copying what others do well. It means understanding the bar you need to meet or exceed to compete for AI citations in your niche. If competing content provides basic overviews, offering in-depth analysis gives you an advantage. If competitors focus on theory, adding practical examples and case studies differentiates you. If everyone covers similar points, finding unique angles or addressing overlooked aspects of the topic creates competitive advantage.\nDistribution and promotion strategies must extend beyond traditional channels to build the multi-platform presence that signals authority to AI models. This means systematically sharing your expertise across relevant communities, contributing to discussions on forums and social media, publishing on platforms like Medium or LinkedIn in addition to your own site, and building genuine relationships within your niche rather than just broadcasting content.\nThe goal isn't maximum reach across every possible platform—that's neither sustainable nor effective. Instead, identify the two or three platforms where your target audience genuinely spends time and where your expertise provides value. Focus your distribution efforts there, building consistent presence and contributing meaningfully over time. This focused approach generates better results than scattered efforts across a dozen platforms.\nCollaboration and linking strategy matter differently for AIO than for traditional SEO. While backlinks remain important for search engine rankings, AI citation rates appear more influenced by the quality and relevance of the connection than purely by link volume. Being cited by a highly authoritative source in your niche can boost AI visibility even if it provides only one link, while dozens of low-quality directory links might not impact AI citations at all.\nThis suggests prioritizing genuine partnerships, guest posting on respected sites in your industry, and earning mentions from authoritative sources through excellent work rather than pursuing link-building tactics focused purely on volume. The relationship-based approach to link acquisition aligns well with AIO because it creates the kind of genuine authority signals that AI models recognize and value.\nThe Future Trajectory of AI Search\nUnderstanding where AI search is headed helps you prepare for upcoming changes rather than constantly reacting to new developments. While predicting specific features or timeline is difficult, several clear trends are shaping the evolution of AI-powered discovery.\nThe most obvious trend is continued growth in AI search usage. As more people discover tools like ChatGPT, Claude, and Perplexity, and as these tools improve their interfaces and expand capabilities, the percentage of information-seeking behavior flowing through AI models will increase. This doesn't necessarily mean traditional search engines will disappear, but it does mean the traffic pie is being redivided, with AI search claiming an expanding slice.\nThis growth trajectory suggests that early adoption advantages in AIO will compound over time. Establishing strong AI visibility now, while competition remains relatively light, positions you favorably as usage explodes and competition intensifies. The content creators building AI authority today will have structural advantages over those who wait until AI search is fully mainstream and optimization becomes more competitive.\nIntegration between different search modalities is accelerating. Google is bringing AI answers into traditional search results. Bing is integrating ChatGPT-powered features. New platforms are emerging that combine search, AI chat, and traditional browsing in unified experiences. This convergence means optimization strategies must account for hybrid discovery experiences where users might see both traditional results and AI-generated answers, potentially in the same interface.\nThe technical sophistication of AI models continues advancing rapidly, with implications for optimization strategies. Future models will better understand nuance, maintain longer context, cross-reference information more effectively, and potentially access real-time data more seamlessly. These improvements might make some current optimization tactics less important while creating new opportunities for differentiation.\nFor example, as models improve at understanding semantic meaning and context, exact keyword matching will matter even less than it does now. Conversely, models might become better at assessing content quality through subtle signals like writing sophistication, logical coherence, and comprehensive coverage. This evolution favors creators focused on genuine quality over those trying to game systems through technical tricks.\nPersonalization in AI search is emerging as models learn to consider individual user preferences, history, and context when formulating responses. This creates both opportunities and challenges for content visibility. The opportunity is that AI might recommend your content more prominently to users whose preferences align with your perspective or style. The challenge is that you might become invisible to users whose personalization profile doesn't match, even if your content is objectively relevant to their query.\nAdapting to this personalized future likely requires building distinct brand identity and perspective rather than trying to be everything to everyone. If AI models categorize you clearly—as the practical, actionable advice source versus the theoretical deep-dive resource—you'll appear reliably for users whose preferences match that positioning. Trying to be too generic might result in appearing rarely for anyone as models route users to more distinctive alternatives.\nCommercial considerations will shape AI search evolution as platforms figure out monetization beyond subscriptions. We're already seeing early experiments with citations including affiliate tracking, sponsored placements in AI responses, and premium content partnerships. The specific implementations will evolve, but the trajectory toward commercial integration seems certain.\nFor content creators, this commercial evolution might create new opportunities to monetize AI visibility beyond indirect traffic benefits. If platforms begin sharing revenue with cited sources, strong AI visibility could become directly profitable. If sponsored placements become normalized, there might be ways to amplify your organic visibility through paid promotion similar to how PPC complements SEO.\nRegulation and AI model behavior around copyrighted content remains in flux, with implications for what content models can reference and how prominently different sources appear. Current legal frameworks are struggling to accommodate AI's information synthesis capabilities, and future regulations might significantly impact how models cite sources, what compensation creators receive, and what controls you have over whether AI systems can reference your content.\nStaying informed about these regulatory developments and adjusting strategy accordingly will matter increasingly. The content creators who navigate this evolving landscape successfully will be those who remain flexible and adapt to changes rather than expecting today's rules to persist indefinitely.\nPractical Implementation Plan\nTransforming AIO knowledge into actual improved visibility requires systematic implementation rather than sporadic efforts. Here's a practical framework for incorporating these strategies into your content workflow.\nStart with an audit of your existing content to identify which pieces should be prioritized for AIO optimization. Not every article deserves equal attention—focus first on content that already performs well in traditional search, addresses important topics for your audience, or covers queries where you have genuine expertise to offer. These high-potential pieces are most likely to generate meaningful results from optimization efforts.\nDuring the audit, evaluate each priority article against the seven optimization tactics. Does it include specific statistics and verifiable data? Could you add more? Is the content structured with clear headings that reflect natural language questions? Have you included an FAQ section addressing common queries? Is there a clear \"last updated\" date? Can you add comparison tables or other structured data? Does schema markup exist and is it appropriate for the content type?\nCreate a prioritized optimization checklist based on this audit, identifying which pieces need which improvements. Some content might only need a few additions like update dates and FAQ sections, while others might benefit from more substantial restructuring. This systematic approach prevents you from trying to fix everything at once and ensures you tackle the highest-impact improvements first.\nImplement changes incrementally, testing as you go rather than making all modifications simultaneously. This allows you to learn which specific changes seem to impact your AI citation rates most significantly. While many factors influence visibility, you might discover that certain tactics work particularly well for your niche or content style, allowing you to prioritize those approaches for future content.\nFor new content creation, build AIO considerations into your standard workflow. Before writing, identify the key questions your content will answer and structure your outline around those questions. Plan to include specific data points and examples during research. Decide what structured elements (tables, step-by-step lists, comparisons) would enhance the content. Add these considerations to whatever content creation process you already use rather than treating AIO as a separate, optional step.\nEstablish monitoring routines to track your AI visibility over time. Whether you use commercial tracking tools or build your own system, schedule regular reviews of your performance. Monthly checks might suffice initially, though weekly monitoring makes sense if you're actively optimizing and want faster feedback on what's working.\nWhen reviewing tracking data, look for patterns rather than obsessing over individual fluctuations. Is your visibility generally improving, declining, or stable? Which topics show stronger AI citation rates? Where are competitors consistently appearing instead of you? What queries used to show your content but no longer do? These patterns inform where to focus future optimization efforts and what's working well versus what needs adjustment.\nBuild a distribution schedule that ensures your content reaches the platforms where community discussion happens. Rather than sporadic promotion when you remember, systematically share new content and participate in relevant discussions on a regular cadence. This might mean dedicating 30 minutes daily to community engagement, or setting aside specific times weekly for distribution activities. The consistent approach yields better results than irregular bursts of activity.\nDocument what works as you implement and test different approaches. Keep notes on which tactics seem most effective for your content, which platforms drive the most engaged traffic, which topics generate the most AI citations. This knowledge base becomes increasingly valuable over time as you identify patterns specific to your niche and audience that might differ from general best practices.\nConsider forming or joining groups of content creators in your niche who are also working on AIO to share insights and results. The field is new enough that collective learning accelerates progress for everyone involved. What you discover about effective tactics in your niche might help others, and their experiences can inform your strategy even if you're in slightly different spaces.\nPlan for iterative improvement rather than expecting immediate perfection. AIO is still an emerging practice without definitive best practices etched in stone. You'll make mistakes, try things that don't work, and occasionally optimize for factors that turn out not to matter. This experimentation is part of the learning process. What matters is systematic iteration—trying approaches, measuring results, adjusting based on feedback, and gradually improving your effectiveness over time.\nSet realistic timelines for seeing results. Unlike paid advertising where you can generate traffic immediately, organic visibility through either SEO or AIO builds gradually. You might see some quick wins from optimizing high-performing content, but establishing strong overall AI visibility typically takes months of consistent effort. Understand this going in to maintain motivation during the initial period where you're investing effort without dramatic visible results.\nTaking Action Today\nThe opportunity in AI Optimization exists because most content creators haven't recognized its importance yet. Traditional SEO remains the primary focus, while this emerging traffic channel grows rapidly with relatively light competition. This window won't stay open indefinitely. As more people understand AIO's value, competition will intensify and optimization will become more sophisticated.\nYour competitive advantage comes from starting now rather than waiting until AIO is fully mainstream. Begin with these immediate actions that require minimal investment but start building your foundation.\nFirst, test your own AI visibility today. Open ChatGPT, Claude, or Perplexity and ask questions where your content should logically appear as a relevant source. Be honest in your queries—use the actual questions your audience would ask rather than phrasing things to favor your content. See whether AI models cite you, and if so, how prominently. This reality check shows you where you stand currently.\nSecond, identify your top five most important pieces of content—articles that address core topics for your audience or drive significant traffic currently. These become your initial optimization targets. Don't try to optimize everything at once. Focus on making these five pieces as strong as possible for AI citation.\nThird, implement quick wins on those priority pieces. Add \"Last updated: [current date]\" to each. Create a simple FAQ section addressing three to five common questions related to each article's topic. Add specific statistics or data points if they're currently missing. These improvements take hours rather than days but can meaningfully impact AI visibility.\nFourth, set up basic tracking even if you don't build a comprehensive system immediately. Create a simple spreadsheet listing queries where you want visibility. Test those queries weekly in one or two AI platforms and note whether your content appears. This manual tracking takes just 15-30 minutes weekly but provides feedback on whether your optimization efforts are working.\nFifth, join one or two communities where your target audience discusses topics related to your content. You don't need to be everywhere—pick platforms where you can genuinely contribute value and commit to participating regularly. Start by reading and understanding the community culture before posting, then gradually engage in discussions where your expertise adds value.\nThe investment required isn't massive. You don't need expensive tools, extensive technical knowledge, or a large team. You need understanding of the principles, systematic implementation of practical tactics, and consistency over time. The same qualities that make someone successful with traditional content creation—providing genuine value, maintaining quality standards, and persisting through the gradual process of building authority—work for AIO as well.\nThe difference is timing. Traditional SEO is mature with intense competition and well-established players dominating many niches. AIO is emerging with room for newcomers to establish authority while the landscape is still taking shape. This timing advantage creates opportunities for content creators of all sizes to build significant AI visibility if they act now rather than waiting.\nStart today. Audit your content. Implement quick optimizations. Begin tracking your performance. Engage in communities. Build the multi-platform presence that signals authority. Each small step compounds over time into substantial competitive advantage as AI search grows to represent an ever-larger percentage of how people discover information online.\nThe future of organic visibility includes AI citations alongside traditional search rankings. The question isn't whether to optimize for both—it's whether you'll start while competition is light or wait until fighting for AI visibility becomes as challenging as ranking in traditional search is today.\nChoose wisely. The traffic is already flowing. The only question is whether it flows to you or your competitors.",

    "summary": "In the rapidly advancing landscape of AI technology and innovation, LimeWire emerges as a unique platform in the realm of generative AI tools. This platform not only stands out from the multitude of existing AI tools but also brings a fresh approach to content generation. LimeWire not only empowers users to create AI content but also provides creators with creative ways to share and monetize their creations.\n\n\nAs we explore LimeWire, our aim is to uncover its features, benefits for creators, and the exciting possibilities it offers for AI content generation. This platform presents an opportunity for users to harness the power of AI in image creation, all while enjoying the advantages of a free and accessible service.\n\n\nLet's unravel the distinctive features that set LimeWire apart in the dynamic landscape of AI-powered tools, understanding how creators can leverage its capabilities to craft unique and engaging AI-generated images.\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n\n\n\n\nLimeWire, a name once associated with the notorious file-sharing tool from the 2000s, has undergone a significant transformation. The LimeWire we discuss today is not the file-sharing application of the past but has re-emerged as an entirely new entity—a cutting-edge AI content publishing platform.\n\n\nThis revamped LimeWire invites users to register and unleash their creativity by crafting original AI content, which can then be shared and showcased on the LimeWire Studio. Notably, even acclaimed artists and musicians, such as Deadmau5, Soulja Boy, and Sean Kingston, have embraced this platform to publish their content in the form of NFT music, videos, and images.\n\n\nBeyond providing a space for content creation and sharing, LimeWire introduces monetization models to empower users to earn revenue from their creations. This includes avenues such as earning ad revenue and participating in the burgeoning market of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). As we delve further, we'll explore these monetization strategies in more detail to provide a comprehensive understanding of LimeWire's innovative approach to content creation and distribution.\n\n\nLimeWire Studio welcomes content creators into its fold, providing a space to craft personalized AI-focused content for sharing with fans and followers. Within this creative hub, every piece of content generated becomes not just a creation but a unique asset—ownable and tradable. Fans have the opportunity to subscribe to creators' pages, immersing themselves in the creative journey and gaining ownership of digital collectibles that hold tradeable value within the LimeWire community. Notably, creators earn a 2.5% royalty each time their content is traded, adding a rewarding element to the creative process.\n\n\nThe platform's flexibility is evident in its content publication options. Creators can choose to share their work freely with the public or opt for a premium subscription model, granting exclusive access to specialized content for subscribers.\n\n\nLimeWire AI Studio\nAs of the present moment, LimeWire focuses on AI Image Generation, offering a spectrum of creative possibilities to its user base. The platform, however, has ambitious plans on the horizon, aiming to broaden its offerings by introducing AI music and video generation tools in the near future. This strategic expansion promises creators even more avenues for expression and engagement with their audience, positioning LimeWire Studio as a dynamic and evolving platform within the realm of AI-powered content creation.\n\n\nAI Image Generation Tools\n\n\n\n\n\nThe LimeWire AI image generation tool presents a versatile platform for both the creation and editing of images. Supporting advanced models such as Stable Diffusion 2.1, Stable Diffusion XL, and DALL-E 2, LimeWire offers a sophisticated toolkit for users to delve into the realm of generative AI art.\n\n\nMuch like other tools in the generative AI landscape, LimeWire provides a range of options catering to various levels of complexity in image creation. Users can initiate the creative process with prompts as simple as a few words or opt for more intricate instructions, tailoring the output to their artistic vision.\n\n\n\n\nWhat sets LimeWire apart is its seamless integration of different AI models and design styles. Users have the flexibility to effortlessly switch between various AI models, exploring diverse design styles such as cinematic, digital art, pixel art, anime, analog film, and more.

    "link": "https://techncruncher.blogspot.com/2022/06/most-frequently-asked-questions-about.html",
    "pubDate": "Wed, 01 Jun 2022 13:03:00 +0000",

    "summary": "There are lots of questions floating around about how affiliate marketing works, what to do and what not to do when it comes to setting up a business. With so much uncertainty surrounding both personal and business aspects of affiliate marketing. In this post, we will answer the most frequently asked question about affiliate marketing\n\n1. What is affiliate marketing?\n Affiliate marketing is a way to make money by promoting the products and services of other people and companies. You don't need to create your product or service, just promote existing ones. That's why it's so easy to get started with affiliate marketing. You can even get started with no budget at all!\n\n\n2. What is an affiliate program?\n An affiliate program is a package of information you create for your product, which is then made available to potential publishers. The program will typically include details about the product and its retail value, commission levels, and promotional materials. Many affiliate programs are managed via an affiliate network like ShareASale, which acts as a platform to connect publishers and advertisers, but it is also possible to offer your program directly.\n3. What is an affiliate network and how do affiliate networks make money? \n Affiliate networks connect publishers to advertisers.  Affiliate networks make money by charging fees to the merchants who advertise with them; these merchants are known as advertisers. The percentage of each sale that the advertiser pays is negotiated between the merchant and the affiliate network.\n4. What's the difference between affiliate marketing and dropshipping?\n Dropshipping is a method of selling that allows you to run an online store without having to stock products. You advertise the products as if you owned them, but when someone makes an order, you create a duplicate order with the distributor at a reduced price. The distributor takes care of the post and packaging on your behalf. As affiliate marketing is based on referrals and this type of drop shipping requires no investment in inventory when a customer buys through the affiliate link, no money exchanges hands.\n 5. Can affiliate marketing and performance marketing be considered the same thing?\n\n\n\n\n Performance marketing is a method of marketing that pays for performance, like when a sale is made or an ad is clicked This can include methods like PPC (pay-per-click) or display advertising. Affiliate marketing is one form of performance marketing where commissions are paid out to affiliates on a performance basis when they click on their affiliate link and make a purchase or action.\n 6. Is it possible to promote affiliate offers on mobile devices?\n Smartphones are essentially miniature computers, so publishers can display the same websites and offers that are available on a PC. But mobiles also offer specific tools not available on computers, and these can be used to good effect for publishers. Publishers can optimize their ads for mobile users by making them easy to access by this audience. Publishers can also make good use of text and instant messaging to promote their offers. As the mobile market is predicted to make up 80% of traffic in the future, publishers who do not promote on mobile devices are missing out on a big opportunity.\n7. Where do I find qualified publishers?\n The best way to find affiliate publishers is on reputable networks like ShareASale Cj(Commission Junction), Awin, and Impact radius. These networks have a strict application process and compliance checks, which means that all affiliates are trustworthy.\n8. What is an affiliate disclosure statement?\n An affiliate disclosure statement discloses to the reader that there may be affiliate links on a website, for which a commission may be paid to the publisher if visitors follow these links and make purchases.\n 9. Does social media activity play a significant role in affiliate marketing?\n Publishers promote their programs through a variety of means, including blogs, websites, email marketing, and pay-per-click ads. Social media has a huge interactive audience, making this platform a good source of potential traffic.\n10. What is a super affiliate?\n A super affiliate is an affiliate partner who consistently drives a large majority of sales from any program they promote, compared to other affiliate partners involved in that program.  Affiliates make a lot of money from affiliate marketing Pat Flynn earned more than $50000 in 2013 from affiliate marketing.\n11. How do we track publisher sales activity?\n Publishers can be identified by their publisher ID, which is used in tracking cookies to determine which publishers generate sales. The activity is then viewed within a network's dashboard.\n 12. Could we set up an affiliate program in multiple countries?\n Because the Internet is so widespread, affiliate programs can be promoted in any country. Affiliate strategies that are set internationally need to be tailored to the language of the targeted country.\n13. How can affiliate marketing help my business?\nAffiliate marketing can help you grow your business in the following ways:\n\n\n It allows you to save time and money on marketing, which frees you up to focus on other aspects of your business.\n You get access to friendly marketers who are eager to help you succeed. \nIt also helps you to promote your products by sharing links and banners with a new audience.\n It offers high ROI(Return on investment) and is cost-effective.\n\n\n 14. How do I find quality publishers?\n One of the best ways to work with qualified affiliates is to hire an affiliate marketing agency that works with all the networks. Affiliates are carefully selected and go through a rigorous application process to be included in the network.\n15. How Can we Promote Affiliate Links?\n Affiliate marketing is generally associated with websites, but there are other ways to promote your affiliate links, including:\n\n\nA website or blog\nThrough email marketing and newsletter\nSocial media, like Facebook, Instagram, or Twitter.\n Leave a comment on blogs or forums.\nWrite an e-book or other digital product.\nYoutube\n\n\n 16. Do you have to pay to sign up for an affiliate program?\n To build your affiliate marketing business, you don't have to invest money in the beginning. You can sign up for free with any affiliate network and start promoting their brands right away.\n17. What is a commission rate?\n Commission rates are typically based on a percentage of the total sale and in some cases can also be a flat fee for each transaction. The rates are set by the merchant.\nWho manages your affiliate program?\n Some merchants run their affiliate programs internally, while others choose to contract out management to a network or an external agency.\n18. What is a cookie?\n Cookies are small pieces of data that work with web browsers to store information such as user preferences, login or registration data, and shopping cart contents. When someone clicks on your affiliate link, a cookie is placed on the user's computer or mobile device. That cookie is used to remember the link or ad that the visitor clicked on. Even if the user leaves your site and comes back a week later to make a purchase, you will still get credit for the sale and receive a commission it depends on the site cookies duration\n19. How long do cookies last?\n The merchant determines the duration of a cookie, also known as its “cookie life.” The most common length for an affiliate program is 30 days. If someone clicks on your affiliate link, you’ll be paid a commission if they purchase within 30 days of the click.\nFinal Saying\nMost new affiliates are eager to begin their affiliate marketing business. Unfortunately, there is a lot of bad information out there that can lead inexperienced affiliates astray. Hopefully, the answer to your question will provide clarity on how affiliate marketing works and the pitfalls you can avoid. Most importantly, keep in mind that success in affiliate marketing takes some time. Don't be discouraged if you're not immediately making sales or earning money. It takes most new affiliates months to make a full-time income.",

    "summary": "If you want to pay online, you need to register an account and provide credit card information. If you don't have a credit card, you can pay with bank transfer. With the rise of cryptocurrencies, these methods may become old.\n\nImagine a world in which you can do transactions and many other things without having to give your personal information. A world in which you don’t need to rely on banks or governments anymore. Sounds amazing, right? That’s exactly what blockchain technology allows us to do.\nIt’s like your computer’s hard drive. blockchain is a technology that lets you store data in digital blocks, which are connected together like links in a chain. \nBlockchain technology was originally invented in 1991 by two mathematicians, Stuart Haber and W. Scot Stornetta. They first proposed the system to ensure that timestamps could not be tampered with.\nA few years later, in 1998, software developer Nick Szabo proposed using a similar kind of technology to secure a digital payments system he called “Bit Gold.” However, this innovation was not adopted until Satoshi Nakamoto claimed to have invented the first Blockchain and Bitcoin.\nSo, What is Blockchain?\nA blockchain is a distributed database shared between the nodes of a computer network. It saves information in digital format. Many people first heard of blockchain technology when they started to look up information about bitcoin.\nBlockchain is used in cryptocurrency systems to ensure secure, decentralized records of transactions.\nBlockchain allowed people to guarantee the fidelity and security of a record of data without the need for a third party to ensure accuracy.\nTo understand how a blockchain works, Consider these basic steps:\n\n\nBlockchain collects information in “blocks”.\nA block has a storage capacity, and once it's used up, it can be closed and linked to a previously served block.\nBlocks form chains, which are called “Blockchains.”\nMore information will be added to the block with the most content until its capacity is full. The process repeats itself.\nEach block in the chain has an exact timestamp and can't be changed.\n\n\nLet’s get to know more about the blockchain.\nHow does blockchain work?\nBlockchain records digital information and distributes it across the network without changing it. The information is distributed among many users and stored in an immutable, permanent ledger that can't be changed or destroyed. That's why blockchain is also called \"Distributed Ledger Technology\" or DLT.\nHere’s how it works:\n\n\nSomeone or a computer will transacts\nThe transaction is transmitted throughout the network.\nA network of computers can confirm the transaction.\nWhen it is confirmed a transaction is added to a block\nThe blocks are linked together to create a history.\n\n\n      if (typeof atAsyncOptions !== 'object') var atAsyncOptions = [];\n      atAsyncOptions.push({\n          'key': '8a426783aef805554f3d96c19f8beeb7',\n          'format': 'js',\n          'async': true,\n          'container': 'atContainer-8a426783aef805554f3d96c19f8beeb7',\n          'params' : {}\n      });\n      var script = document.createElement('script');\n      script.type = \"text/javascript\";\n      script.async = true;\n      script.src = 'http' + (location.protocol === 'https:' ? 's' : '') + '://www.topcreativeformat.com/8a426783aef805554f3d96c19f8beeb7/invoke.js';\n      document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(script);\n  \n\n  \n\nAnd that’s the beauty of it! The process may seem complicated, but it’s done in minutes with modern technology. And because technology is advancing rapidly, I expect things to move even more quickly than ever.\n\n\nA new transaction is added to the system. It is then relayed to a network of computers located around the world. The computers then solve equations to ensure the authenticity of the transaction.\nOnce a transaction is confirmed, it is placed in a block after the confirmation. All of the blocks are chained together to create a permanent history of every transaction.\n\n\nHow are Blockchains used?\nEven though blockchain is integral to cryptocurrency, it has other applications. For example, blockchain can be used for storing reliable data about transactions. Many people confuse blockchain with cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum.\nBlockchain already being adopted by some big-name companies, such as Walmart, AIG, Siemens, Pfizer, and Unilever. For example, IBM's Food Trust uses blockchain to track food's journey before reaching its final destination.\nAlthough some of you may consider this practice excessive, food suppliers and manufacturers adhere to the policy of tracing their products because bacteria such as E. coli and Salmonella have been found in packaged foods. In addition, there have been isolated cases where dangerous allergens such as peanuts have accidentally been introduced into certain products.\nTracing and identifying the sources of an outbreak is a challenging task that can take months or years. Thanks to the Blockchain, however, companies now know exactly where their food has been—so they can trace its location and prevent future outbreaks.\nBlockchain technology allows systems to react much faster in the event of a hazard. It also has many other uses in the modern world.\nWhat is Blockchain Decentralization?\nBlockchain technology is safe, even if it’s public. People can access the technology using an internet connection.\nHave you ever been in a situation where you had all your data stored at one place and that one secure place got compromised? Wouldn't it be great if there was a way to prevent your data from leaking out even when the security of your storage systems is compromised?\nBlockchain technology provides a way of avoiding this situation by using multiple computers at different locations to store information about transactions. If one computer experiences problems with a transaction, it will not affect the other nodes.\nInstead, other nodes will use the correct information to cross-reference your incorrect node. This is called “Decentralization,” meaning all the information is stored in multiple places.\nBlockchain guarantees your data's authenticity—not just its accuracy, but also its irreversibility. It can also be used to store data that are difficult to register, like legal contracts, state identifications, or a company's product inventory.\nPros and Cons of Blockchain\nBlockchain has many advantages and disadvantages. \nPros\n\n\nAccuracy is increased because there is no human involvement in the verification process.\nOne of the great things about decentralization is that it makes information harder to tamper with.\nSafe, private, and easy transactions\nProvides a banking alternative and safe storage of personal information\n\n\nCons\n\n\nData storage has limits.\nThe regulations are always changing, as they differ from place to place.\nIt has a risk of being used for illicit activities \n\n\nFrequently Asked Questions About Blockchain\nI’ll answer the most frequently asked questions about blockchain in this section.\nIs Blockchain a cryptocurrency?\nBlockchain is not a cryptocurrency but a technology that makes cryptocurrencies possible. It's a digital ledger that records every transaction seamlessly.\nIs it possible for Blockchain to be hacked?\nYes, blockchain can be theoretically hacked, but it is a complicated task to be achieved. A network of users constantly reviews it, which makes hacking the blockchain difficult.\nWhat is the most prominent blockchain company?\nCoinbase Global is currently the biggest blockchain company in the world. The company runs a commendable infrastructure, services, and technology for the digital currency economy.\nWho owns Blockchain?\nBlockchain is a decentralized technology. It’s a chain of distributed ledgers connected with nodes. Each node can be any electronic device. Thus, one owns blockhain.\nWhat is the difference between Bitcoin and Blockchain technology?\nBitcoin is a cryptocurrency, which is powered by Blockchain technology while Blockchain is a distributed ledger of cryptocurrency \nWhat is the difference between Blockchain and a Database?\nGenerally a database is a collection of data which can be stored and organized using a database management system. The people who have access to the database can view or edit the information stored there. The client-server network architecture is used to implement databases. whereas a blockchain is a growing list of records, called blocks, stored in a distributed system. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, timestamp and transaction information. Modification of data is not allowed due to the design of the blockchain. The technology allows decentralized control and eliminates risks of data modification by other parties.\nFinal Saying\nBlockchain has a wide spectrum of applications and, over the next 5-10 years, we will likely see it being integrated into all sorts of industries. From finance to healthcare, blockchain could revolutionize the way we store and share data. Although there is some hesitation to adopt blockchain systems right now, that won't be the case in 2022-2023 (and even less so in 2026). Once people become more comfortable with the technology and understand how it can work for them, owners, CEOs and entrepreneurs alike will be quick to leverage blockchain technology for their own gain.

Grammarly highlights all the mistakes in your writing within seconds of copying and pasting the content into Grammarly’s editor or using the software’s native feature in other text editors.\nNot only does it identify tiny grammatical and spelling errors, it tells you when you overlook punctuations where they are needed. And, beyond its plagiarism-checking capabilities, Grammarly helps you proofread your content. Even better, the software offers a free plan that gives you access to some of its features.",

    "summary": "Are you searching for an ecomerce platform to help you build an online store and sell products?\nIn this Sellfy review, we'll talk about how this eCommerce platform can let you sell digital products while keeping full control of your marketing.\nAnd the best part? Starting your business can be done in just five minutes.\nLet us then talk about the Sellfy platform and all the benefits it can bring to your business.\nWhat is Sellfy?\nSellfy is an eCommerce solution that allows digital content creators, including writers, illustrators, designers, musicians, and filmmakers, to sell their products online. Sellfy provides a customizable storefront where users can display their digital products and embed \"Buy Now\" buttons on their website or blog. Sellfy product pages enable users to showcase their products from different angles with multiple images and previews from Soundcloud, Vimeo, and YouTube. Files of up to 2GB can be uploaded to Sellfy, and the company offers unlimited bandwidth and secure file storage. Users can also embed their entire store or individual project widgets in their site, with the ability to preview how widgets will appear before they are displayed.\nFeatures\nSellfy includes:\nOnline Store\nSellfy is a powerful e-commerce platform that helps you personalize your online storefront. You can add your logo, change colors, revise navigation, and edit the layout of your store. Sellfy also allows you to create a full shopping cart so customers can purchase multiple items. And Sellfy gives you the ability to set your language or let customers see a translated version of your store based on their location.\nSellfy gives you the option to host your store directly on its platform, add a custom domain to your store, and use it as an embedded storefront on your website. Sellfy also optimizes its store offerings for mobile devices, allowing for a seamless checkout experience.\nProduct hosting\nSellfy allows creators to host all their products and sell all of their digital products on one platform. Sellfy also does not place storage limits on your store but recommends that files be no larger than 5GB. Creators can sell both standard and subscription-based products in any file format that is supported by the online marketplace. Customers can purchase products instantly after making a purchase – there is no waiting period.\nYou can organize your store by creating your product categories, sorting by any characteristic you choose. Your title, description, and the image will be included on each product page. In this way, customers can immediately evaluate all of your products. You can offer different pricing options for all of your products, including \"pay what you want,\" in which the price is entirely up to the customer. This option allows you to give customers control over the cost of individual items (without a minimum price) or to set pricing minimums—a good option if you're in a competitive market or when you have higher-end products. You can also offer set prices per product as well as free products to help build your store's popularity.\nSellfy is ideal for selling digital content, such as ebooks. But it does not allow you to copyrighted material (that you don't have rights to distribute).\nEmbed options\nSellfy offers several ways to share your store, enabling you to promote your business on different platforms. Sellfy lets you integrate it with your existing website using \"buy now\" buttons, embed your entire storefront, or embed certain products so you can reach more people. Sellfy also enables you to connect with your Facebook page and YouTube channel, maximizing your visibility.\nPayments and security\nSellfy is a simple online platform that allows customers to buy your products directly through your store. Sellfy has two payment processing options: PayPal and Stripe. You will receive instant payments with both of these processors, and your customer data is protected by Sellfy's secure (PCI-compliant) payment security measures. In addition to payment security, Sellfy provides anti-fraud tools to help protect your products including PDF stamping, unique download links, and limited download attempts.\n\n      if (typeof atAsyncOptions !== 'object') var atAsyncOptions = [];\n      atAsyncOptions.push({\n          'key': '8a426783aef805554f3d96c19f8beeb7',\n          'format': 'js',\n          'async': true,\n          'container': 'atContainer-8a426783aef805554f3d96c19f8beeb7',\n          'params' : {}\n      });\n      var script = document.createElement('script');\n      script.type = \"text/javascript\";\n      script.async = true;\n      script.src = 'http' + (location.protocol === 'https:' ?

I'll analyze each tool to see how they differ\nin interfaces, keyword research resources, rank tracking, and competitor\nanalysis.\nUser Interface\nAhrefs and SEMrush both offer comprehensive information\nand quick metrics regarding your website's SEO performance. However, Ahrefs\ntakes a bit more of a hands-on approach to getting your account fully set up,\nwhereas SEMrush's simpler dashboard can give you access to the data you need\nquickly.\nIn this section, we provide a brief overview of the elements\nfound on each dashboard and highlight the ease with which you can complete\ntasks.\nAHREFS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Ahrefs dashboard is less cluttered than that of\nSEMrush, and its primary menu is at the very top of the page, with a search bar\ndesigned only for entering URLs.\nAdditional features of the Ahrefs platform include:\n\nYou can see analytics from the dashboard, including\nsearch engine rankings to domain ratings, referring domains, and backlink\nJumping from one tool to another is easy.

Market\nExplorer also allows users to perform in-depth data analytics on These\ncompanies and markets.\nWHO WINS?\nSEMrush wins here because it has more tools dedicated to\ncompetitor analysis than Ahrefs. However, Ahrefs offers a lot of functionality\nin this area, too. It takes a combination of both tools to gain an advantage\nover your competition.\nPricing\nAhrefs\n\nLite Monthly: $99/month\nStandard Monthly: $179/month \nAnnually Lite: $990/year\nAnnually Standard: $1790/year\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSEMRUSH\n\nPro Plan: $119.95/month\nGuru Plan:$229.95/month\nBusiness Plan: $449.95/month\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich SEO tool should you choose for digital\nmarketing?\nWhen it comes to keyword data research, you will become\nconfused about which one to choose.\nConsider choosing Ahrefs if you\n\nLike friendly and clean interface\nSearching for simple keyword suggestions\n\n\n\n\n\nWant to get more keywords for different search engines\nlike Amazon, Bing, Yahoo, Yandex, Baidu, and more \n\n\n\n \nConsider SEMrush if you:\n\nWant more marketing and SEO features\nNeed competitor analysis tool\nNeed to keep your backlinks profile clean\nLooking for more keyword suggestions for Google\n\n\n\nBoth tools are great.

    "title": "Most Frequently Asked Questions About NFTs(Non-Fungible Tokens)",
    "link": "https://techncruncher.blogspot.com/2022/02/most-frequently-asked-questions-about.html",
    "pubDate": "Sun, 06 Feb 2022 10:04:00 +0000",
    "source": "Crunch Hype",
    "summary": "Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are the most popular digital assets today, capturing the attention of cryptocurrency investors, whales and people from around the world. People find it amazing that some users spend thousands or millions of dollars on a single NFT-based image of a monkey or other token, but you can simply take a screenshot for free. So here we share some freuently asked question about NFTs.\n1) What is an NFT?\nNFT stands for non-fungible  token, which is a cryptographic token on a blockchain with unique identification codes that distinguish it from other tokens. NFTs are unique and not interchangeable, which means no two NFTs are the same. NFTs can be a unique artwork, GIF, Images, videos, Audio album. in-game items, collectibles etc.\n2) What is Blockchain?\nA blockchain is a distributed digital ledger that allows for the secure storage of data. By recording any kind of information—such as bank account transactions, the ownership of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), or Decentralized Finance (DeFi) smart contracts—in one place, and distributing it to many different computers, blockchains ensure that data can’t be manipulated without everyone in the system being aware.\n3) What makes an NFT valuable?\n\n\nThe value of an NFT comes from its ability to be traded freely and securely on the blockchain, which is not possible with other current digital ownership solutionsThe NFT points to its location on the blockchain, but doesn’t necessarily contain the digital property. For example, if you replace one bitcoin with another, you will still have the same thing. If you buy a non-fungible item, such as a movie ticket, it is impossible to replace it with any other movie ticket because each ticket is unique to a specific time and place.\n4) How do NFTs work?\nOne of the unique characteristics of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) is that they can be tokenised to create a digital certificate of ownership that can be bought, sold and traded on the blockchain. \nAs with crypto-currency, records of who owns what are stored on a ledger that is maintained by thousands of computers around the world. These records can’t be forged because the whole system operates on an open-source network. \nNFTs also contain smart contracts—small computer programs that run on the blockchain—that give the artist, for example, a cut of any future sale of the token.\n5) What’s the connection between NFTs and cryptocurrency?\nNon-fungible tokens (NFTs) aren't cryptocurrencies, but they do use blockchain technology. Many NFTs are based on Ethereum, where the blockchain serves as a ledger for all the transactions related to said NFT and the properties it represents.5) How to make an NFT?\nAnyone can create an NFT. All you need is a digital wallet, some ethereum tokens and a connection to an NFT marketplace where you’ll be able to upload and sell your creations\n6) How to validate the authencity of an NFT?\nWhen you purchase a stock in NFT, that purchase is recorded on the blockchain—the bitcoin ledger of transactions—and that entry acts as your proof of ownership.\n7) How is an NFT valued? What are the most expensive NFTs?\nThe value of an NFT varies a lot based on the digital asset up for grabs. People use NFTs to trade and sell digital art, so when creating an NFT, you should consider the popularity of your digital artwork along with historical statistics.\nIn the year 2021, a digital artist called Pak created an artwork called The Merge. It was sold on the Nifty Gateway NFT market for $91.8 million.\n8) Can NFTs be used as an investment?\nNon-fungible tokens can be used in investment opportunities. One can purchase an NFT and resell it at a profit. Certain NFT marketplaces let sellers of NFTs keep a percentage of the profits from sales of the assets they create.\n9) Will NFTs be the future of art and collectibles?\nMany people want to buy NFTs because it lets them support the arts and own something cool from their favorite musicians, brands, and celebrities. NFTs also give artists an opportunity to program in continual royalties if someone buys their work. Galleries see this as a way to reach new buyers interested in art.\n10) How do we buy an NFTs?\nThere are many places to buy digital assets, like opensea and their policies vary. On top shot, for instance, you sign up for a waitlist that can be thousands of people long. When a digital asset goes on sale, you are occasionally chosen to purchase it.\n11) Can i mint NFT for free?\nTo mint an NFT token, you must pay some amount of gas fee to process the transaction on the Etherum blockchain, but you can mint your NFT on a different blockchain called Polygon to avoid paying gas fees. This option is available on OpenSea and this simply denotes that your NFT will only be able to trade using Polygon's blockchain and not Etherum's blockchain. Mintable allows you to mint NFTs for free without paying any gas fees.\n12) Do i own an NFT if i screenshot it?\n\n      if (typeof atAsyncOptions !== 'object') var atAsyncOptions = [];\n      atAsyncOptions.push({\n          'key': 'adee9769ea74eb59e82d4f0cb2e6f816',\n          'format': 'js',\n          'async': true,\n          'container': 'atContainer-adee9769ea74eb59e82d4f0cb2e6f816',\n          'params' : {}\n      });\n      var script = document.createElement('script');\n      script.type = \"text/javascript\";\n      script.async = true;\n      script.src = 'http' + (location.protocol === 'https:' ? 's' : '') + '://www.topcreativeformat.com/adee9769ea74eb59e82d4f0cb2e6f816/invoke.js';\n      document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(script);\n  \n\n  \n\nThe answer is no. Non-Fungible Tokens are minted on the blockchain using cryptocurrencies such as Etherum, Solana, Polygon, and so on. Once a Non-Fungible Token is minted, the transaction is recorded on the blockchain and the contract or license is awarded to whoever has that Non-Fungible Token in their wallet.\n12) Why are people investing so much in NFT?\n Non-fungible tokens have gained the hearts of people around the world, and they have given digital creators the recognition they deserve. One of the remarkable things about non-fungible tokens is that you can take a screenshot of one, but you don’t own it. This is because when a non-fungible token is created, then the transaction is stored on the blockchain, and the license or contract to hold such a token is awarded to the person owning the token in their digital wallet.\n\nYou can sell your work and creations by attaching a license to it on the blockchain, where its ownership can be transferred. This lets you get exposure without losing full ownership of your work. Some of the most successful projects include Cryptopunks, Bored Ape Yatch Club NFTs, SandBox, World of Women and so on. These NFT projects have gained popularity globally and are owned by celebrities and other successful entrepreneurs. Owning one of these NFTs gives you an automatic ticket to exclusive business meetings and life-changing connections.\nFinal Saying\nThat’s a wrap. Hope you guys found this article enlightening. I just answer some question with my limited knowledge about NFTs. If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to drop them in the comment section below. Also I have a question for you, Is bitcoin an NFTs? let me know in The comment section below",

    "title": "Most Frequently Asked Questions About  Email Marketing",
    "link": "https://techncruncher.blogspot.com/2022/01/most-frequently-asked-questions-about.html",
    "pubDate": "Sat, 29 Jan 2022 12:45:00 +0000",
    "source": "Crunch Hype",
    "summary": "1. Why is email marketing important?\nEmail is the marketing tool that helps you  create a seamless, connected, frictionless buyer journey. More importantly, email marketing allows you to build relationships with prospects, customers, and past customers. It's your chance to speak  to them right in their inbox, at a time that suits them. Along with the right message, email can become one of your most powerful marketing channels.\n2. What is benefits of email marketing?\nEmail marketing is best way for creating long term relationship with your clients, and increasing sales in our company.\n\n\nBenefits of email marketing for bussiness:\n\nBetter brand recognition\nStatistics of what works best\nMore sales\nTargeted audience\nMore traffic to your products/services/newsletter\nBuild credibility\n\nMost  bussinesses are using email marketing and making tons of money with email marketing.\n\n\n3. What is the simplest day and time to send my marketing emails?\n\n\nAgain, the answer to this question varies from company to company. And again, testing is the way to find out what works best. Typically, weekends and mornings seem to be  times when multiple emails are opened, but since your audience may have different habits, it's best to experiment and then use your  data to decide.\n\n\n 4. Which metrics should I be looking at?\n\n\nThe two most important metrics for email marketing are  open rate and click-through rate. If your emails aren't opened, subscribers will never see your full marketing message, and if they open them but don't click through to your site, your emails won't convert.\n\n\n5. How do I write a decent subject line?\n\n\nThe best subject lines are short and to the point, accurately describing  the content of the email, but also catchy and intriguing, so the reader wants to know more. Once Again, this is the perfect place for  A/B testing, to see what types of subject lines work best with your audience. Your call to action should be clear and  simple. It should be somewhere at the top of your email for those who haven't finished reading the entire email,  then repeated  at the end for those reading all the way through. It should state exactly what you want subscribers to do, for example \"Click here to download the premium theme for free.\n\n\n\n6. Is email marketing still effective?\nEmail marketing is one of the most effective ways for a business to reach its customers directly. Think about it. You don't post something on your site  hoping people will visit it. You don't even post something on a social media page and hope fans  see it. You're sending something straight to each person's inbox, where they'll definitely  see it! Even if they don't open it, they'll still see your subject line and business name every time you send an email, so you're still communicating directly with your audience.\n\n\n\n7. However do I grow my email subscribers list? Should i buy an email list or build it myself?\nBuying an email list is  waste of time & money. These email accounts are unverified and not interested in your brand. The mailing list is useless if your subscribers do not open your emails. There are different ways to grow your mailing list. \n\n\nGive them a free ebook and host it on a landing page where they have to enter the email to download the file and also create a forum page on your website, asks your visitors what questions they might have about your business, and collects email addresses to follow up with them.\n\n\n      if (typeof atAsyncOptions !== 'object') var atAsyncOptions = [];\n      atAsyncOptions.push({\n          'key': '05a47ba863f62ec113e14b51b976d14a',\n          'format': 'js',\n          'async': true,\n          'container': 'atContainer-05a47ba863f62ec113e14b51b976d14a',\n          'params' : {}\n      });\n      var script = document.createElement('script');\n      script.type = \"text/javascript\";\n      script.async = true;\n      script.src = 'http' + (location.protocol === 'https:' ? 's' : '') + '://www.topcreativeformat.com/05a47ba863f62ec113e14b51b976d14a/invoke.js';\n      document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(script);\n  \n\n  \n\n\n\n8. How do I prevent audience from unsubscribing?\n\n\nIf the  subject line of the email is irrelevant to  customers, they will ignore it multiple times. But, if it keeps repeating, they are intercepted and unsubscribed from your emails. So, send relevant emails for the benefit of the customer. Don't send emails that often only focus  on sales, offers and discounts. \nSubmit information about your business and offers so you can connect with customers. You can also update them on recent trends in your industry. The basic role of an email is first and foremost to  connect with customers, get the most out of this tool.\n\n\n9. What is the difference between a cold email and a spam email?\n\n\nCold emails are mostly sales emails that are sent with content align to the needs of the recipient. It is usually personalized and includes a business perspective. However, it is still an unsolicited email. And all unsolicited emails are marked as SPAM. \nRegularly receiving this type of unsolicited email in your users' inboxes, chances are  your emails will soon be diverted to  spam or junk folders. The most important thing to prevent this from happening is to respect your recipients' choice to opt-out of receiving emails from you. You can add the links to easily unsubscribe. You must be familiar with the CAN-SPAM Act and its regulations.\n\n\n10. Where can I find email template?\nAlmost all email campaign tools provide you with ready-made templates. Whether you use MailChimp or Pardot, you'll get several email templates ready to use.\n However, if you want to create a template from scratch, you can do so.Most of email campaign tools have option to paste the HTML code of your own design. \n\n11. What email marketing trend will help marketers succeed in 2022?\nIs it a trend to listen to  and get to know your customers? I think people realize how bad it feels for a brand or a company to obsess over themselves without knowing their customers personal needs. People who listen empathetically and then provide value based on what they learn will win.\n\n\nFinal Saying\n\n\n You can approach email marketing in different ways.
