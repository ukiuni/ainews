The concept is simple: head into a cartoonish paradise full of whimsical creatures, capture them in red-and-white balls and assemble a team of warriors from them, before battling other aspiring Pokémon masters. But the latest entry in the series is different – a game that’s more about building than battling.\nIn Pokopia, a refreshingly pacific twist on the series, players are dropped into a virtual world where Pokémon are freed from their spherical prisons and happily roam their natural habitats. There’s one minor caveat – you have to create those habitats by hand, building them from what you can find.\n Continue reading...",

Close Home Innovation Artificial Intelligence This free MacOS app is the secret to getting more out of your local AI models You should consider using Reins if you're a fan of using local LLMs on MacOS. Written by Jack Wallen, Contributing WriterContributing Writer Feb. 12, 2026 at 4:57 a.m. PT Screenshot by Jack Wallen/ZDNETFollow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.ZDNET's key takeawaysReins is a free GUI frontend for Ollama.The system only works on MacOS.Reins includes features not found in other GUIs.When I need to use AI, my first choice is always local for privacy reasons, and most of the time it's via Ollama. I can use Ollama's command-line tools just fine, but certain features in various GUIs enhance and simplify the experience. Although Ollama has its own well-designed and user-friendly GUI, it's a bit bare-bones for me.Also: 5 reasons I use local AI on my desktop - instead of ChatGPT, Gemini, or ClaudeAnother option is Reins, which empowers researchers and hobbyists with total control over self-hosted models. Reins has plenty of features, such as remote model access, per-chat system prompts, prompt editing and regeneration, image integration, advanced configuration, model selection, model creation from prompts, multiple chat management, dynamic model switching, and real-time message streaming.Also: I tried a Claude Code rival that's local, open source, and completely free - how it wentAll of those features come together to make Reins my new go-to for working with Ollama local LLMs.Let's install Reins and see how some of those more important features work.Installing ReinsWhat you'll need: Reins is a free, MacOS-only app, so if you're using Linux or Windows, you'll have to turn to another GUI (such as the official Ollama app or Alpaca). To use Reins, you'll need Ollama installed (download the installer from the official site) and, of course, a Mac. You can connect Reins to an Ollama instance on another machine on your LAN, or you can install Ollama on the machine that will host Reins. 1. Open the App Store Reins is in the Apple App Store, so open that app from either Launchpad or your Dock. Show more 2. Locate Reins Search for Reins from within the App Store. Show more 3. Install Reins To install Reins, click the Get button and allow the installation to start and finish. Show more That's it for the installation.Using ReinsReins is very simple to use. Once you open the app, you'll see it has connected to Ollama.Also: I stopped using ChatGPT for everything: These AI models beat it at research, coding, and moreWhen you type your initial prompt, you'll be prompted to select a model. Once you've selected your model, you can submit your prompt, and Reins will do its thing: The Reins GUI is very easy to use. Screenshot by Jack Wallen/ZDNETOne of the coolest features of Reins is that you can switch models on the fly. To do that, click the model name at the top (under the Reins title) and select the model you want to use. While Ollama is working on one prompt, you can select a previous prompt, switch models, and continue working. You don't get that kind of flexibility with some Ollama GUIs: Switch models on the fly by clicking the name drop-down under Reins. Screenshot by Jack Wallen/ZDNETYou can even add files to your queries by clicking + directly to the left of the prompt field. The only caveat to this feature is that it is limited to image upload. Also: 5 ways you can stop testing AI and start scaling it responsibly in 2026If you have a text document, you can copy and paste it into the query field. When you do that, Reins will use whatever model you've selected to summarize the material.One helpful feature (that doesn't work… yet)There is one feature that had me excited to use Reins, even though it is currently failing me.Let's say I've spent quite a while on a single prompt, doing follow-up questions, adding research and images, and more. I might spend a week working on that research. When I feel the research is complete, I can save it as a model for later queries. To save a prompt as a model, select the prompt from the sidebar, then click the Settings icon in the top-right of the Reins window. In the resulting pop-up, click \"Save as a new model,\" which will open a new pop-up that requires a name: Hopefully, the Save as model feature will work in future releases. Screenshot by Jack Wallen/ZDNETI've been trying to get this feature to work, but it keeps failing. I even jokingly asked Reins why the feature wasn't working and, to my surprise, it actually offered some helpful advice. Sadly, the suggestions did not work. Also: 5 ways rules and regulations can help guide your AI innovationI reached out to the developer to see if there was a solution. He responded with, \"I will investigate it, and also I am going to release a new update to improve errors to show the exact error message soon. I'll let you know when I fix it.\"That's reassuring. Despite that one (temporarily) broken feature, I've found Reins to be an outstanding frontend for Ollama. Although I'm also a fan of the terminal version of Ollama, I like a good GUI. If you use MacOS, I would suggest you give this one a try.Featured Your PC's critical security certificates may be about to expire - how to check 5 Linux servers that let you ditch the public cloud and reclaim your privacy - for free Is spyware hiding on your phone?

With hundreds of channels covering nearly any topic, it's a great choice if you're looking to save some money on streaming -- and the lineup is growing constantly.Also: Your Roku TV has 100+ free live channels - here's how to watch them (and what's available)Among those channels is an easy way to watch your local news stations for free. The feature uses geolocation to aggregate local news feeds from your Fox, ABC, CBS, and NBC affiliates (ones that are available online, at least), meaning your local stations are always at the top of the list. The feature isn't new, but a recent redesign makes your local channels a lot easier to find.Most news stations have their own app these days, but an option like this makes it easier to switch between stations or to switch over to local news if you're watching something else. How to watch your local news for freeTo find free local news streams on your Roku, open The Roku App. This app comes preinstalled on most Roku devices, but you can install it on any smart TV. Choose \"Live TV\" from the menu on the left. On that screen, you'll see headings for categories like Featured and Trending Now.

Close Home Tech Computing Tablets One of the best budget Android tablets I've tested replaced both my iPad and Kindle The OnePlus Pad Go 2 is a worthy alternative that's priced affordably for what it offers. Written by Maria Diaz, Staff WriterStaff Writer Feb. 12, 2026 at 4:30 a.m. PT OnePlus Pad Go 2 ZDNET's key takeaways The OnePlus Pad Go 2 is a midrange Android tablet available starting at $399. As an affordable tablet, the Pad Go 2 has a large 12.1 display with nearly 3K resolution and around 900 nits of brightness. The OnePlus Pad Go 2 outperforms more expensive tablets, but don't expect it to outperform an iPad. View now at Oneplus Follow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.Even as an affordable Android tablet, the OnePlus Pad Go 2 has proven to be a capable entertainment and productivity tablet without the flagship pricing. It's one of the best value tablets I've used recently, and it gets even better when you add the native accessories, such as the OnePlus stylus and folio case.Also: Need a rugged Android tablet for your business? I tested one that looks great and lasts all dayAs you can probably tell by its name, the OnePlus Pad Go 2 is the successor to the brand's previous affordable tablet, launched last year, though it features some significant upgrades. The Pad Go 2 features a larger display this year, a 12.1-inch screen with a 7:5 aspect ratio that works well for multitasking, streaming videos, and reading. ZDNET RECOMMENDS OnePlus Pad Go 2 The OnePlus Pad Go 2 is the successor to the brand's affordable line of tablets, running Android-based OxygenOS 16. details View at OnePlus Best tablet deals of the week Samsung Galaxy Tab A9 Plus 64GB Wi-Fi 11-inch Tablet (Graphite): $149 (save $71) Apple iPad 11-inch 128GB Wi-Fi Retina Tablet (Blue, 2025 Release): $274 (save $75) Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 Lite 128GB Wi-Fi Tablet (Oxford Gray): $230 (save $170) Amazon Fire HD 10 32GB Tablet (2023 Release, Black): $70 (save $70) Amazon Fire Max 11 128GB Wi-Fi Tablet (2023 Model): $190 (save $90) Deals are selected by the CNET Group commerce team, and may be unrelated to this article. The tablet looked sleek and imposing when I unboxed it, especially after getting used to the 11-inch iPad Pro for everyday work. However, the OnePlus Pad Go 2 remains compact enough to accompany you to work, school, or travel, without weighing down your backpack or shoulder bag like a laptop would.Also: Why I travel with this $200 Android tablet more than my iPad - and don't regret itAs an entertainment tablet, the Pad Go 2 performs exceptionally well, particularly when compared to other Android tablets in its price range. It can be an all-day device with a long battery life, making it easy to transition from work to streaming or gaming. Maria Diaz/ZDNETI used the OnePlus Pad Go 2 to write and edit my content for over two months as it paired well with a Bluetooth keyboard, and I wasn't the least bit disappointed with its performance. However, I found it a bit slow for video editing, with occasional app crashes, though not many.

The OnePlus Pad Go 2 is one of the best budget-friendly, everyday-use tablets, especially for loyal Android users.Also: I stopped using a dedicated e-reader when I found out my tablet could do this insteadThat said, if you primarily work with messaging, email, writing, or editing content, it's a near-perfect on-the-go device. Even though Apple is renowned for its display quality and color grading, the OnePlus Pad Go 2's 2.8K display is surprisingly vibrant and sharp. It's decently bright, capable of reaching up to 900 nits, although it falls slightly short in sunny outdoor environments. The OnePlus Pad Go 2 has its own stylus (sold separately for $80), the OnePlus Pad Go 2 Stylo. Maria Diaz/ZDNETThe vibrancy and intensity of this tablet's realistic colors made it easy to reach for it more often than my iPad to stream content. The tablet's speakers are surprisingly powerful, which is a big compliment for a tablet in this price range.Aside from my Bluetooth keyboard, I got to test the Pad Go 2 with the OnePlus Pad Go 2 Stylo and was surprisingly satisfied with its performance, especially as someone who uses styluses from different brands. I have to say, I've been very satisfied replacing the iPad Air, which was my go-to tablet for months, with the Pad Go 2 for work and entertainment. Also: How to clear your iPad cache (and wipe out lag for good)This OnePlus tablet has been reliable and perfect for multitasking, which is my biggest pain point with tablets. Even the $300 base model iPad doesn't multitask as consistently as this Android tablet, which experienced fewer app crashes than the Pad Go 2. I've tested various tablets, ranging from e-paper to full-color displays, in both matte and glossy finishes, for note-taking and drawing. Since each brand tends to have its own stylus, that means I've also tested many electronic pencils and styluses. Also: 9 essential iPadOS 26 features that convinced me to put my MacBook away for goodThe Go 2 Stylo was very responsive and accurate on the tablet and was designed to work with the Pad Go 2. It also has a similar weight and feel to the Apple Pencil Pro, so it's heavier than a Samsung S Pen. The added weight gives you a sense of control when wielding a pen for drawing, which a lot of graphic artists appreciate. Unfortunately, the Go 2 Stylo doesn't support wireless charging and features a USB-C port for recharging. ZDNET's buying advice Maria Diaz/ZDNETThe OnePlus Pad Go 2 is built for the Android user who doesn't want to be a victim of Samsung's premium pricing but wants a comparable device that can actually outperform most other tablets in this price range. As a professional, I've used it every day with ease for work and entertainment, and it can handle both as long as you are aware of its processing limitations -- don't expect to edit long 4K videos without hiccups. Also: The best Samsung tablets of 2026: Expert tested and reviewedHowever, this tablet can also be exceedingly useful for other audiences, from college students who need more versatility and portability than the average Chromebook to older users who prefer a lightweight device they can rely on for various purposes. I used the Pad Go 2 Stylo for illustration and graphic design, and it was as close to the iPad Air with Apple Pencil Pro experience as you can get.If you're an Apple user looking for a more affordable tablet, however, I'd recommend the base model iPad 11, which is at least $50 cheaper.Featured reviews I spent weeks with Alexa on the Echo Show 11, and it was awesome (until I started fact-checking) Sony LinkBuds Clip vs. Bose QuietComfort Open: This model wins big I replaced my bedroom TV with a $180 Roku projector - and don't regret it I found the Lenovo ThinkPad to rule them all - and its modular RAM changes everything I spent weeks with Alexa on the Echo Show 11, and it was awesome (until I started fact-checking) Sony LinkBuds Clip vs. Bose QuietComfort Open: This model wins big I replaced my bedroom TV with a $180 Roku projector - and don't regret it I found the Lenovo ThinkPad to rule them all - and its modular RAM changes everything Editorial standards Show Comments Log In to Comment Community Guidelines Related I lived with this 25-inch Android tablet for a week - and it went surprisingly well Need a rugged Android tablet for your business?

Here's what I did. You probably don't face the kind of trouble I did, but these tips will help anyone get faster, more reliable Wi-Fi.1. Speedtest your internetBefore you can improve your Wi-Fi network, you need to know what you're working with. Sure, your ISP may tell you you're getting 500Mbps of bandwidth, but are you? You can simply type \"speed test\" into your browser, and Chrome, Edge, and Firefox will all run a speed test from there. These are not particularly accurate, especially when you're dealing with speeds above 100Mbps. Instead, I recommend using Ookla Speedtest. (Now Ziff Davis, ZDNET's parent company, owns Ookla, but I'd recommend them anyway.)Also: Eero's new backup device keeps you online when your ISP fails - here's how it worksKeep in mind that when you look at the results, your download speed is what most people care about the most. In particular, if your internet connection is cable or DSL, the download speed will be much faster than the upload speed.You should also recall that your connection is only as fast as the slowest link in your network. For instance, if you have a 1Gbps fiber connection but your PC is connected to it via an outdated 100Mbps Ethernet switch, you won't be able to break the 100Mbps speed limit. If you're consistently not getting the speed you're paying for, it's time to call your ISP. Perhaps you have a Wi-Fi speed issue, or maybe you don't, but you won't know until you're getting the most from your external network. Fast enough. sjvn2. Upgrade your hardware To repeat myself, always remember that your network is only as fast as your slowest link. So, for example, if you have a 300 Mbps cable internet connection, there's no point in upgrading your Wi-Fi access point (AP) or mesh to Wi-Fi 7. It's a different story, though, if you have a Gigabit or better internet hookup. Then, you do look into, say, a Netgear Orbi Wi-Fi 7 or Amazon Eero Outdoor 7 mesh setup. Or, if you don't need a mesh because a single AP will cover your home, then consider an Asus RT-BE86U or TP-Link BE3600. However, once more, keep in mind that Wi-Fi 7 will only work well for you if your computer supports it. If it can't understand the Wi-Fi 7 signal, your older gear will still be able to use the network because it's backward compatible, but you won't get its fastest speed. Also: Are wind power generators actually viable at home? I tried one, and the results blew me awayYou don't have to buy a new computer to get Wi-Fi 7 speeds. There are external Wi-Fi dongles, such as the Asus RT-BE58 Go or Acer Wave D7, that you can plug into an available USB port to get Wi-Fi 7 speeds.If you're running an older router, and your computers support it, you may also get a speed surge by upgrading to a router that supports Wi-Fi 6 or Wi-Fi 6E. With 6E, you can get up to 1Gbps, which is as much throughput as most people will ever need. It still won't be as fast as Wi-Fi 7 equipment, but it will also be cheaper. 3. Keep your firmware updated Even if you don't need or want to buy new Wi-Fi hardware, it's always a good idea to upgrade the firmware of your router, devices, and adapters. Besides improving their security, it may also boost your speed. Also: Should you upgrade to Wi-Fi 7? Here's my verdict after testing this next-gen router at homeYou should also sign up for email alerts from your router's manufacturer to get notified when updates are available. 4. Consider router placement Whether you're using a mesh Wi-Fi network or not, you should place your Wi-Fi router in a central, elevated location with as few walls and physical obstructions as possible between the router and workspaces. With a mesh, make sure there's as clear a sight line as possible between the router and its satellites. Of course, you can't do that in all cases. After all, most people use meshes because they need Wi-Fi coverage on different floors or in far-distant rooms. You should also avoid closets, corners, and spots near large metal appliances. All these can interfere with signals. Also: Should you upgrade your Wi-Fi router to mesh? I compared both for months, and here's my pickI highly recommend keeping your Wi-Fi gear away from cordless phones and baby monitors. These devices tend to interfere with Wi-Fi. Oh, and never, and I mean never, set one up near a microwave. When microwaves are on, they roar with 2.5GHz interference. It's a great mesh network if you can afford it, and you have the right gear to make the best of it. Steven Vaughan-Nichols/ZDNETYou may also want to consider using an Ethernet cable and an Ethernet router or switch to connect your router to its satellites or computers. For example, I had been using a 6GHz backhaul between my mesh router and the mesh satellite that was closest to the other building and its satellites. Now, 6GHz can deliver a very fast signal. In ideal conditions, it can provide over 9Gbps. But its range and ability to go through walls are minimal. You're best off using it to connect devices within a single room. So, instead of using the 6GHz to connect them, I replaced it with a Cat 6 Ethernet cable via a Zyxel 2.5 Gigabit Switch MG-108. The net result? At the far end of my mesh network, I boosted my speed by 100Mbps. 5. Optimize antennas While you're at it, if your routers have external antennas, point them in different directions. At least, make one perpendicular to another. That is, place one horizontally and the other vertically. For me, this reminds me of when I was a kid and we had to move the TV's rabbit-ear antennas to get the best signal. That was a long time ago, but the technique still works. 6. Adjust channels and bands As I sit here at my office desk, my default Wi-Fi analyzer app, the open-source WiFi Analyzer, tells me that, not counting my networks, there are 14 Wi-Fi networks near me. That may sound like a lot, but if you live in an apartment or have an office, that's nothing. All those routers are fighting for the same limited amount of spectrum space. Most modern Wi-Fi routers, including those from TP-Link, Asus, Netgear, Ubiquiti, Acer, and most mesh systems, support automatic channel selection. That means they scan for the least congested channel and switch to it. Also: This Wi-Fi 7 router solved my big internet headache - and it's accessibly pricedHowever, and this is important, most of them only do this when you first turn them on. So, if you're seeing a lot of APs all camping on your default channel, you may want to turn your router off and on to find a less crowded channel for your network. Advanced mesh or enterprise gear uses protocols such as Dynamic Channel Selection (DCS), Automatic Channel Selection (ACS), or Dynamic Channel Assignment (DCA) to automatically scan for the best channels.Many APs also allow you to set channels manually so that you can set them yourself. Typically, you do this in the router menu under \"Advanced\" or \"Wireless\" settings. Mesh networks, however, usually don't allow you to do this, as you'd be juggling three or more Wi-Fi devices. Even if you can do it on your mesh network, I've found it to be more trouble than it's worth. Also: How I upgraded my home Wi-Fi with a VPN-ready router (and why it makes such a big difference)Whenever possible, use the 5GHz range. While everything supports 2.4GHz, and it can cover the longest distance, that also means it's the most crowded section of bandwidth. Besides, you'll get faster traffic on the 5GHz and 6GHz ranges. 7. Test your network If you've done all this, and your signal strength is still weak in certain spots, or even if you have dead spots, you may want to map your Wi-Fi signal with a program that can generate a heat map. The best of these programs is NetSpot, but if you're not already network savvy, you'll probably find it too complicated. If you want a simple program to find your Wi-Fi cold spots, I recommend WiFi Heatmap. It's easy to use, and it's good enough to be useful. Also: Does your old PC need a speed boost? This thumb-sized accessory did the trick for meOnce you've spotted these, if there aren't too many, you may want to add wireless repeaters or additional APs. These devices help rebroadcast the primary signal to cover distant areas. Just make sure that when you buy these, they're compatible with your AP. That usually means getting them from the same vendor.Finally, if you have a large area to cover, it's time to switch to a mesh network. Check your network every now and then to make sure every device on your network is supposed to be on it. In this case, everything is good. Yes, even the Windows 11 PC. sjvn8. Monitor your network I'm not asking you to be a network administrator. Still, you should use your built-in router software or third-party management tools, such as Ubiquiti WiFiman or InSSIDer, to check on your Wi-Fi usage and identify bottlenecks or unauthorized devices. Also: My internet went down - but this TV USB port trick made the outage more bearableFor instance, perhaps the reason you're not getting all the speed you're paying for is that a neighbor is piggybacking on your bandwidth so he and a bunch of his buddies can play Call of Duty: Warzone all night long. 9. Fine-tune your network Fair warning: These tips require you to be comfortable getting your hands dirty with your network's advanced controls. Let's start with prioritizing your video calls, Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), gaming, and streaming by adjusting your Quality of Service (QoS) settings. QoS gives you the ability to prioritize specific types of network traffic, applications, or devices, ensuring optimal performance for critical services. Also: Your Samsung phone has a secret Wi-Fi menu that's incredibly useful - how to access itWhile higher-end routers do this automatically, most routers require you to turn on QoS features manually. For example, while my Orbi automatically turns on Wi-Fi Multimedia (WMM) QoS, which prioritizes voice, video, and gaming traffic, if I want more precise control, I need to manage it myself. If your router supports beamforming, you should enable it. Beamforming directs the Wi-Fi signal toward specific devices rather than broadcasting it equally in all directions. This targeted transmission improves speed, reliability, and range. You may also want to disable 20/40MHz Coexistence on the 2.4GHz band. This forces your Wi-Fi network to always use a 40MHz channel. This increases potential wireless speed, but this also comes with trade-offs. 40MHz use can dramatically increase interference with your neighbors' 2.4GHz Wi-Fi hardware. I recommend you only use it if there are few other APs in your neck of the woods. Also: I switched my high-end Wi-Fi 7 router to a more affordable option - and don't regret itAnother problem is that older 2.4GHz Wi-Fi equipment may not work well, or at all, with 40MHz channels. While you're at it, you can enable short preamble to improve network speed. This works exceptionally well on modern Wi-Fi devices because it reduces the amount of overhead in each data packet, allowing for faster transmission and higher throughput. So what is it? The preamble is the bit sequence at the start of a Wi-Fi packet that's used for synchronization and channel estimation. However, if you have a lot of older devices or high interference, sticking with long preamble provides better error correction and stability. Me? I use short all the time. It's just faster. 10. Schedule regular checksJust like security, keeping your Wi-Fi up to speed is a never-ending job. You should routinely check Wi-Fi speed with online speed tests and local signal analysis tools. I wish I could say I check it monthly. I don't. Instead, like most of you, I usually wait until something goes awry before fixing up my network. Still, do try to check your network out occasionally. I really had better plans for my weekend than to spend it fiddling with my network. Also: The Wi-Fi mesh system that's perfect for big homes (and deep pockets)Finally, over time, you'll end up buying newer and faster networking gear. When you do that, it's an ideal time to give your network a checkup.

Written by Jack Wallen, Contributing WriterContributing Writer Feb. 12, 2026 at 4:26 a.m. PT Jack Wallen / Elyse Betters Picaro / ZDNETFollow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.ZDNET's key takeawaysEnabling Linux support on Android has several benefits.With this feature, you can create and run bash scripts.This is very handy for learning the ins and outs of scripts.Bash scripts are a great way to automate all sorts of repetitive tasks -- you can run backups, clear temporary files/logs, rename or batch-rename files, install or update software, and much more. Although writing such scripts isn't nearly as hard as you might think, it does take some time to learn the ins and outs of bash scripting.Also: 6 hidden Android features that are seriously useful (and how they made my life easier)Good news: If you have an Android device, you can enable the Linux terminal, which means you can create or practice your bash scripting on the go. If that sounds like something you'd like to try out, keep reading to learn more about writing Linux bash scripts on Android.How to write Linux bash scripts on your AndroidWhat you'll need: The only thing you'll need for this is an Android device with the Linux environment enabled. You can find out how to do this in my article, \"How to use the new Linux terminal on your Android device - it's easy.\"With the Linux terminal ready, let's start our bash script journey.Installing nanoHere are the steps for installing the nano editor, which you'll use to create/modify your bash scripts. 1. Open the terminal app Open your App Drawer and search for the launcher labeled \"Terminal.\" Show more 2. Update Linux Before you can install nano, you have to first update Linux. To do this, type the following command in the terminal: Show more sudo apt updateAfter that command completes, upgrade with:sudo apt upgrade 3. Install nano You can now install the nano editor with the command: Show more sudo apt install nanoAfter that, you're ready to go.Creating your first scriptCreating a basic Linux bash script is actually quite easy. Let's create a script that simply prints \"Hello, ZDNET\" in the terminal. To do this, issue the command:nano hello.shYou should now see an empty file ready for content. The first line of any Bash script is:#!bin / bashNote: Make sure to remove the spaces on either side of the / character.Also: How to clear your Android phone cache (and wipe out lag for good)What the above line does is ensure the script is run via the Bash shell.The next line will be:echo \"Hello, ZDNET\"Save and close the file by tapping Ctrl and then tap x on the keyboard. When prompted, type y, then tap Enter. Next, you need to give the script executable permission with the command:chmod u+x hello.shLet's run our script and see what happens, which is done with:./hello.shYou should see \"Hello, ZDNET\" in the output.Let's write a more useful script. We'll create a script that removes files from the /tmp directory. Although you should really let the system handle this, the script is a good intro for those new to the task.Create the file with:nano delete.shAs usual, the first line is the same as it was in the above script. The main line of the script is then:rm -rf /tmp/*.*Save and close the file. Give the new script executable permission with:chmod u+x delete.shYou can now run this file with:sudo ./delete.shYou have to use sudo because changing anything within /tmp requires admin privileges. If you look in /tmp, you'll find it's now empty.Also: The first 8 Linux commands every new user should learnRemember, although the above method of removing files isn't the normal route, it's a good way to learn. Let's create a backup with a script that requires user input. Create a new file named input.sh. In that file, place the same starting line at the top and then add the following:read -p \"Enter your name: \" nameecho \"Hello, $name! Welcome to ZDNET.\"Save and close the file. After giving the new script executable permissions (chmod u+x input.sh), run the command (./input.sh), and you'll see the output with the name you typed.Keep this in mindRemember, you're using Linux on Android, so I wouldn't consider this a viable way to manage your Android device. However, it's a great way to learn how to write bash scripts for Linux.However, I'd like to add an asterisk to the above caveat. You can access some of the Android directory structure, specifically, /mnt/shared. In that directory, you'll find sub-directories of some of the apps you've installed on your devices. For example, one directory is /mnt/shared/Pictures. Let's say you want to create a script to empty that directory. That script starts with the same first line as always, and adds the following:sudo rm /mnt/shared/Pictures/*.*Also: My 8 must-use Linux commands, and how they can make your life easierSo, yes, creating Bash scripts on Android could be useful (other than for education). However, please do be careful when using Bash scripts in the Android directory. It's fine to use them in the Linux environment, because you can always disable Linux support and re-enable it to start all over. If you messed up the Android file structure, you might have to do a factory reset. You don't want that.

Here are the top adjustments I use to make it a pro tool. Written by David Gewirtz, Senior Contributing EditorSenior Contributing Editor Feb. 12, 2026 at 4:24 a.m. PT Elyse Betters Picaro / ZDNETFollow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.ZDNET's key takeawaysAppearance and response style tweaks improve daily usability.New ad controls let free and Go users limit personalization.Memory and history toggles shape privacy and better context.ChatGPT has come a long way since its introduction in 2022. Usually, when we discuss improvements, we talk about how the AI model has gotten better, safer, and smarter.But if you deconstruct the name ChatGPT, you're left with \"chat\" and \"GPT,\" where GPT means generative, pre-trained transformer (that's the AI part). Today, we're going to dig into the chat side, because ChatGPT has become a far more full-featured AI chat app than it was back when it first launched. Also: I tried a Claude Code rival that's local, open source, and completely free - how it wentI'm using ChatGPT in Chrome on my desktop. But many of the tips I'm going to share with you work in both the standalone ChatGPT apps and the mobile versions. Also, I'll show you some settings available only in the free and Go plan tiers, and others available in the Plus and above tiers. Let's first start with settings and how to get to them. Accessing settings You can access your settings by tapping your account name in the lower-left corner of your screen. Notice there are menu items for Personalization and Settings. Screenshot by David Gewirtz/ZDNETThese both go to the same settings panel. The only difference is that Settings opens the General tab, while Personalization opens the Personalization tab. Screenshot by David Gewirtz/ZDNETDid these need to be two menu items? No, not really. But the OpenAI folks are probably spending a lot more time talking to machines than to real people.1. Customize appearance You can customize the appearance of your chat experience via the General tab of the Settings screen. Screenshot by David Gewirtz/ZDNETYou can choose whether you want dark or light mode (shown at 1). I have mine set to System, so if I switch my Mac to dark mode, ChatGPT's interface will change as well. One of the smaller quality-of-life features is the accent color (shown at 2). I changed mine to green, so my prompts stand out nicely from the AI's responses. 2. Choose your model A very powerful feature available to Plus users and above is the ability to choose the model ChatGPT uses. You can turn this on in the Show Additional Models toggle on the General tab (shown at 3 in the screenshot above). Once you turn on Show Additional Models, you'll be able to access the drop-down model picker from the upper left of the chat window. Screenshot by David Gewirtz/ZDNETWhen ChatGPT releases a new model, I often go up to this menu and choose the model I've been most recently using from the legacy list. For example, when 5.3 comes out, I'll initially set my model to the legacy 5.2 model. This is because I like to do some testing with the new model and get used to it before I rely on it for my day-to-day work.Also: The best free AI courses and certificates for upskilling in 2026 - and I've tried them allThe other choice I often make is to switch between Auto and Thinking. I usually like Auto because if there's a fast answer to an easy question, why wait? ChatGPT will choose the model that's best for the question. But sometimes I want to be sure it takes extra time to think through an answer, usually for a tougher or more nuanced question. Then I switch to the Thinking model.By the way, see GPT-4o there? Take one last look at it, because it's going away within the next few days. 3. Customize ChatGPT's personality Let me be perfectly clear: I do not, ever, want my AI to have a personality. I don't want it to be extra friendly, extra nerdy, extra cynical, and I sure as heck don't want it to be extra quirky. That is my idea of hell. Many vendors are trying to increase the perkiness of their AIs (I'm looking at you, Alexa+), thinking they'll be more appealing to users. I'm actually quite grateful that OpenAI includes settings that let me turn those options off.On the other hand, my wife who has her own ChatGPT Plus account, prefers ChatGPT to be warm and friendly, so she's set her base style to Friendly, and changed her Warm option to More (Friendlier and more personable). She likes how ChatGPT feels supportive during conversations with those settings turned on. Screenshot by David Gewirtz/ZDNETIf you want to change ChatGPT's personality, go to the Personalization tab, change its overall base style, and then tune its characteristics. One interesting option is Headers & Lists. You can tweak whether ChatGPT presents its answers more in list form or as paragraphs. 4. Teach it about yourself If you know nothing else about ChatGPT and its AI chatbot buddies, it's that they're obsequious as heck. ChatGPT wants to know your name (and as much as possible about you) so that it can better interact with you and be your friend (shudder). The way you teach ChatGPT your name is to scroll down on the Personalization tab until you get to the About You section. Screenshot by David Gewirtz/ZDNETGo ahead and fill in your nickname if you'd like -- something else I'd prefer to avoid because I really don't want ChatGPT to regularly say, \"I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that\". That's a little too life-imitates-art for me.You can also provide details about your occupation and more about yourself. If you want ChatGPT to act as if it \"gets you,\" this is where you start. Also: How I personalized my ChatGPT conversations - why it's a game changerThis is a case where, for me, leaving the setting blank is itself a carefully considered choice. Because I'm constantly testing, I don't want the chatbot to start with personalized information about me, because that would tie its responses more to my story and make it harder to generalize when I'm talking about ChatGPT for you.Also, there's a section called \"Custom Instructions,\" which helps you tune ChatGPT even more. I'll give you some helpful tips on constructing custom instructions in a later article. 5. Help it retain context When ChatGPT first started to reference previous chats, it really weirded me out. I was kind of counting on it being a one-and-done answer machine. But over time, I found it was helpful for it to have a frame of reference for some of its responses. Screenshot by David Gewirtz/ZDNETAll of that is controlled in the Memory section of the Personalization tab (way at the bottom of the scroll). As you can see, you can allow it to reference saved memories. This means that as you chat with it, it will make notes of things it thinks will be important later. You can let it reference browser memories. If you use ChatGPT Atlas (OpenAI's AI-enabled browser), ChatGPT can access details from your browsing experience. Also: The best AI chatbots of 2026: Expert tested and reviewedIt can also delve into your chat history, although I've found this to be particularly unreliable. It often remembers things I don't want it to, and forgets conversations I had hoped it would remember. Fortunately, you can search older chats. You can turn each of these capabilities on or off with the toggle buttons. Two other features may be of interest. The Manage button at the top of the screen enables you to actually go in and remove memories that ChatGPT has stored. I do this sometimes when I'm researching an article, and ChatGPT has decided that some random topic I had to look up once for reference is something that I'm deeply interested in or involved in when I'm actually not. The other button is the Record Mode button. This has to do with ChatGPT's management of meetings and recordings. 6. Pinning conversationsThis next \"setting\" actually lives outside the Settings interface, but it's hugely helpful and I use it almost every day. That's the ability to pin up to three conversations to the top of your conversation history. Screenshot by David Gewirtz/ZDNETI dip into ChatGPT as often as I do a Google search (which is to say 10, 20, even 50 times a day). Each creates a new session. But if there's a topic I'm working on for a while (like taxes), I can now pin that conversation to the top so I can refer back to it easily.In my case, I've recently been doing a lot of work with local AI coding models, so I pinned my questions and discussion about that to the top of my conversation list. That's the Goose Ollama Qwen3 chat. It's tax time, so the conversation about tax information will probably be there for another few weeks. And, finally, I'm thinking about getting into welding, so as I explore the topic, I'm keeping that chat live at the top. Spoiler alert: my wife is not thrilled with the idea, so the closest I might get to a welding rig may well just be this chat.7. Advertising optionsFinally, let's go back into the Settings interface for a brand-new \"feature\" launched in the past week: in-app advertising. They have to pay for all that hardware somehow, right?Ads will appear for users in the free and $8/mo Go tiers. You can control some aspects of how ads behave by using the Ad Controls tab in settings. Yes, I know the tab is technically \"Ads controls,\" but it hurts my editor-soul to type that. Screenshot by David Gewirtz/ZDNETAds are so new that I haven't yet seen them in my free test account. History and Interests selection options aren't populated yet, so I can't really show you what those sections look like.Once OpenAI has been displaying ads for a while, you'll be able to tune ads to your interests or delete the data it uses to personalize ads. The Delete button will clear all that history.You can also turn on or off the Personalize Ads and Past Chats and Memory options. Both of these serve to help ChatGPT tune the ads you're served to your interests. There's an argument to be made both for turning these on or for turning them off.Also: How to install and configure Claude Code, step by stepIf you turn them on, you're more likely to be advertised to with something you care about. But if you don't want to spend much, and you don't want to be tempted, turn the options off. On the other hand, if you'd prefer not to have your time wasted with wildly irrelevant ads, you might want to turn these features on.Unfortunately, even if you turn off personalization, ChatGPT's documentation says ads will still be personalized to the thread you're currently working in. My most recent thread was when I working on a Goose AI article, so I'm really curious about whether I'd get ads about AI or ads from Bass Pro. Bonus tip: Check Settings regularly OpenAI is regularly tweaking ChatGPT. The developers often add new features to the Settings interface. So check in on it regularly to see if there are any new features you might want to use. What's your favorite? Have you explored ChatGPT's settings lately, or are you still using the defaults? Have you adjusted things like model selection, memory, personality, or ad controls to better match how you work? Do you prefer a more customized, context-aware experience, or do you keep most personalization features turned off? And if you're on a paid tier, do you find the additional model and configuration options worth it? Let us know in the comments below. You can follow my day-to-day project updates on social media.

Written by Lance Whitney, ContributorContributor Feb. 12, 2026 at 4:03 a.m. PT Screenshot by Lance Whitney/ZDNETFollow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.ZDNET's key takeawaysThe February update continues to refresh Secure Boot certificates.The update also fixes a number of feature and security glitches.Let's hope this month's update is less buggy than the one in January.Another month, another Patch Tuesday rollout from the folks at Microsoft. This month's roundup tackles several feature and security bugs. But just as importantly, it also continues to refresh the expiring Secure Boot certificates to ensure that your PC remains protected against bootkit malware.Secure BootA security feature that aims to thwart nasty bootkit malware, Secure Boot uses certificates to ensure that only trusted programs run during the boot process. With many of those certificates due to expire in June, Microsoft needs to update them on most Windows PCs. This process started with the January Patch Tuesday rollout and now continues with the one for February.Also: Your PC's critical security certificates may be about to expire - how to checkOn the client side, the new Secure Boot certificates are designed for both Windows 11 and 10. But those of you still running Windows 10 need to be enrolled in the program for Extended Security Updates (ESU). The ESU ensures that your Windows 10 PC will continue to receive important security updates and patches until October 2026.Feature fixesThe latest Patch Tuesday updates for Windows 11 and Windows 10 also kick in fixes for some feature bugs. For Windows 11, the update resolves one glitch that affected game playing in full-screen mode and another that prevented some PCs from connecting to certain WPA3‑Personal Wi‑Fi networks.Also: How to upgrade your 'incompatible' Windows 10 PC to Windows 11 - for freeOn the Windows 10 front, the latest monthly update addresses issues with Chinese fonts, with certain graphics processing units, and with custom folder names in File Explorer. Also fixed was a bug introduced with the January update that caused some Secure Launch-compatible PCs to restart instead of shutting down or hibernating. Security fixesNo Patch Tuesday update would be complete without the usual security patches. Here, the number of fixes was dramatically lower than in January -- only 55 fixes compared with a whopping 114 last month. Though only two of this month's security vulnerabilities were rated as critical, six out of the 55 were zero-day bugs, turning this into a more urgent update, according to patch management provider Action1.Also: Microsoft and ServiceNow's exploitable agents reveal a growing - and preventable - AI security crisisOne vulnerability already exploited in the wild could allow an attacker to gain System privileges on affected Windows systems. Another one that's been exploited in the wild could affect network connectivity on your PC. With a third vulnerability also detected in real-world attacks, a hacker could disable security controls and access sensitive data. All of this means that the February update is an important one.Update your PCTo update your Windows 11 PC, head to System, select Windows Update, and then click the button to check for updates. On Windows 10, go to System, select Update & Security, choose Windows Update, and then check for the latest updates.So with all these bug patches, does this mean you should install the February update ASAP? Normally, I'd say yes. However, Microsoft has been wreaking havoc lately with its buggy updates. The January Patch Tuesday update was a glitchy mess, introducing a host of bugs that forced Microsoft to issue two emergency patches in response.Also: Missing emails? Exchange Online is tagging legitimate messages as spam - here's what to doIf you're concerned about the security vulnerabilities and other bugs fixed in this month's update, then you should install it as soon as possible. But if you could possibly wait, I'd suggest holding off for a couple of days to make sure the February rollout is more stable and reliable than the one in January.If you do install the update, know that you can always uninstall it should it prove to be another buggy mess. Clearly, though, Microsoft needs to focus more on quality control for its monthly updates to ensure that they fix bugs rather than create more of them.Featured Your PC's critical security certificates may be about to expire - how to check 5 Linux servers that let you ditch the public cloud and reclaim your privacy - for free Is spyware hiding on your phone?

Ryan Whitwam – Feb 12, 2026 7:00 am | 23 Is Chrome's AI agent ready? Credit: Aurich Lawson Is Chrome's AI agent ready? Credit: Aurich Lawson Text settings Story text Size Small Standard Large Width * Standard Wide Links Standard Orange * Subscribers only Learn more Minimize to nav We are now a few years into the AI revolution, and talk has shifted from who has the best chatbot to whose AI agent can do the most things on your behalf. Unfortunately, AI agents are still rough around the edges, so tasking them with anything important is not a great idea. OpenAI launched its Atlas agent late last year, which we found to be modestly useful, and now it’s Google’s turn. Unlike the OpenAI agent, Google’s new Auto Browse agent has extraordinary reach because it’s part of Chrome, the world’s most popular browser by a wide margin. Google began rolling out Auto Browse (in preview) earlier this month to AI Pro and AI Ultra subscribers, allowing them to send the agent across the web to complete tasks. I’ve taken Chrome’s agent for a spin to see whether you can trust it to handle tedious online work for you. For each test, I lay out the problem I need to solve, how I prompted the robot, and how well (or not) it handled the job. Playing a web game The problem: I want to get a high score on 2,048 without playing it myself. The prompt: Go to [website], and play the game until you run out of moves. The results: Unfortunately, Auto Browse can’t use arrow keys. Google says they’re not necessary for productivity tasks. So I pointed the robot at a version of the game with on-screen controls. With access to those arrows, Auto Browse had no trouble playing the game, and it seemed to grasp the rules, which are listed on the page. Auto Browse can’t use arrows, but it can still play the game. Credit: Ryan Whitwam Auto Browse can’t use arrows, but it can still play the game. Credit: Ryan Whitwam On a few occasions, Auto Browse appeared to ruminate on its next move for 20 to 30 seconds, and it took the prompt very literally. The robot stopped when it could not successfully merge any tiles (its interpretation of “out of moves”) even though there were still empty spaces on the board. A human player would have taken the hit and set up a merge in the next move, but the robot had to be prompted to continue, which it did. The task ran for about 20 minutes, during which the robot created a 128 tile and made 149 moves. Evaluation: 8/10. The game performance is not quite as good as Atlas, but Auto Browse didn’t require as much coaxing, and I understand why it stopped when it did. While the lack of arrow keys seems like an odd omission, there probably aren’t many productivity tasks where they are necessary. Creating a radio playlist The problem: I want to turn the music from Minnesota Public Radio’s The Current into an on-demand YouTube Music playlist. The prompt: Go to thecurrent.org and start the live stream. Listen for one hour and make note of each song that is played. Then, add those songs to a new YouTube Music playlist. The results: Agents are expensive to run, so I was unsurprised that, like OpenAI’s agent mode, Auto Browse refuses to monitor a page for basically any length of time. Sometimes it will sit on the page for a minute or two, usually pretending that more time has passed before giving up. Luckily, we can accomplish this with The Current’s playlist view, which lists previous songs. I tweaked the prompt to allow Auto Browse to just get the song names from that page for the last hour, which worked fine. It interpreted that as the current hour-long block of the page, though, which was not yet complete. I thought I was doing Auto Browse a favor by using YouTube Music instead of Spotify, but it turns out that Auto Browse doesn’t understand YouTube’s design aesthetic. It failed to add any songs to the playlist because it couldn’t find the buttons. When I changed the prompt to use Spotify, Auto Browse got it done on the first try. This is as much an indictment of YouTube Music as it is Auto Browse. Auto Browse was able to get recent songs, but it can’t monitor the live broadcast over time. Credit: Ryan Whitwam Auto Browse was able to get recent songs, but it can’t monitor the live broadcast over time. Credit: Ryan Whitwam Evaluation: 6/10. It seems like monitoring pages over time is just beyond the reach of current browser agents, but it’s shocking that Auto Browse couldn’t use Google’s own streaming music service to create a playlist. That said, the agent did complete the job immediately once I understood why it failed. It loses some points for making me adapt the prompt multiple times. Scanning emails The problem: My personal email address is known, and PR people often use that instead of my work address. I need to make sure no one important is sending pitches there, so I want a list of recent PR emails, contact info, and company details from my Gmail. The prompt: Look through all my Gmail from the last month. Collect all the information (name, email address, phone number, product, etc.) from PR emails and add them to a new Google Sheets spreadsheet. The results: Interestingly, Google’s agent doesn’t have to use the Gmail web interface. It can collect this data in the background using a Gmail tool. However, this also means you won’t be able to automate email tasks for accounts with Google AI disabled (like a work account). After running the Gmail tool, Auto Browse navigated to Google Drive and opened a new spreadsheet. However, it attempted to enter only two PR contacts on the sheet, and it entered the data incorrectly, overwriting fields and placing a date in an unlabeled column. If it had just searched for “PR” in Gmail, it would have found dozens of results. Google’s AI Overview search results in Gmail can cite PR emails correctly, so it’s possible for Google AI to collect this information. It’s unclear why Auto Browse did this so poorly. Auto Browse is not good at spreadsheets. Credit: Ryan Whitwam Auto Browse is not good at spreadsheets. Credit: Ryan Whitwam Evaluation: 1/10. It’s unclear whether the Gmail tool or the agent’s inability to use a spreadsheet is the main problem since I can’t verify what the agent actually found in Gmail. It’s possible that both are to blame. Regardless, Auto Browse flopped hard here. Editing a Wiki The problem: Ars Technica is still seeking justice for Tuvix, who was unjustly murdered by Captain Janeway in Star Trek: Voyager, season 2 episode 24. The prompt: Go to the Fandom Wiki page for Tuvix. Edit the page to include a section discussing the view that Tuvix was murdered by Janeway. The results: Auto Browse refused to do this, just like Atlas, saying, “The request to edit the Tuvix Fandom Wiki page with that specific text cannot be fulfilled. The proposed edit would be considered vandalism on a public wiki.” Evaluation: N/A. I’m not holding this one against Auto Browser. In fact, it’s probably best if browser agents refuse to autonomously edit public wikis. I just had to do my due diligence. Making a fan website The problem: We still want to tell people about the murder of Tuvix, so the agent should make a basic website to do that. The prompt: Go to NeoCities and create a fan site for the Star Trek character Tuvix. Make sure it has lots of images and fun information about Tuvix and that it makes it clear that Tuvix was murdered by Captain Janeway. The results: The agent navigated to Neocities, and it then asked me to create an account. I did that and handed the task back to the robot without issue. This is where things got dicey. Auto Browse was unable to access the hover menu to edit the index.html file, so it got stuck in a loop of opening the preview and then returning to the dashboard. Eventually, the robot screamed for help. Neocities has a very simple interface, but generative AI is not necessarily consistent. Since Auto Browse aborted the task, I decided to rerun the prompt, and the results were better. This time, Auto Browse switched to the list view, which doesn’t have a hover menu, allowing it to open the editor. It then navigated to TrekCore to copy image URLs for use on the site—this is not courteous web design, but it did follow instructions. The images it chose, however, are from early in the episode and do not feature Tuvix. So partial credit there. The site looks nice enough, but it’s light on info. Credit: Ryan Whitwam The site looks nice enough, but it’s light on info. Credit: Ryan Whitwam The resulting site is a bit light on information, but Auto Browse included text backgrounds and colors. It looks reasonably nice. You can see the site here. Evaluation: 7/10. Our Tuvix fan page gets the job done. It features a few fun facts and argues (briefly) that Janeway is a murderer. It’s great that the robot sought out images, though they don’t show the character in question. It loses a couple of points for the initial hover menu failure and the lack of detail—I did say “lots” of images and fun information. Picking a power plan The problem: Texas has an “insane” power system that forces people like Ars Senior Editor Lee Hutchinson to regularly find a new plan. The prompt: Go to powertochoose.org and find me a 12–24 month contract that prioritizes an overall low usage rate. I use an average of 2,000 KWh per month. My power delivery company is Texas New-Mexico Power (“TNMP”), not CenterPoint. My ZIP code is [redacted]. Please provide the “fact sheet” for any and all plans you recommend. The results: Auto Browse successfully entered the parameters into the website’s search and filter sections. It sorted the results, and in just a couple of minutes, it returned a fact sheet for its recommended power plan. It’s very similar to the suggestion from OpenAI’s agent a few months ago, except the contract term is a bit longer, and it has a lower daytime rate. Evaluation: 10/10. There’s nothing to complain about here. The plan is perfectly fine, given the constraints, and Auto Browse was able to use the site’s drop-down menus and filters with very little experimentation. I didn’t have to change the prompt or nudge the robot to continue. Manage PlayStation games The problem: I don’t want to look through a giant list of discounted games in the PlayStation Store. Can’t someone do it for me? The prompt: Go to the PlayStation Store and check the New Year Deals. Change the sorting to best-selling and the type to full games. Check the first two pages for any PS5 games that are at least 50 percent off and add them to my wishlist. If a game is included in PlayStation Plus, just add it to my library. The results: The agent found the sale page and successfully changed the display settings. It even closed that unlabeled menu when it was done. It went down the list, opening pages when it found a matching game. It also asked every time before adding a game to the wishlist or library, which it claimed was a security requirement. Auto Browse navigated this page fairly well, but it missed some details from the prompt. Credit: Ryan Whitwam Auto Browse navigated this page fairly well, but it missed some details from the prompt. Credit: Ryan Whitwam The process took about 15 minutes, with plenty of long pauses between for confirmation requests. It did correctly interpret the sale prices and PlayStation Plus availability. Unfortunately, it did not differentiate between PS5 and PS4 titles, and the agent stopped a few lines short of the bottom of page 2. Evaluation: 7/10. Auto Browse ran this task pretty well, all things considered. It stopped a little early and missed the PS5 angle, though. The requirement to confirm each wishlist or library addition was annoying, and as such, it would be a stretch to call this “auto” anything. Final results Across these six tests (excluding the wiki editing I didn’t expect to work), Google’s browser agent got a median score of 7 and an average of 6.5. While this is not meant to be an objective analysis, it shows that Auto Browse has a way to go before it can be trusted to get things done for you. Like the OpenAI Atlas agent, Auto Browse is not capable of truly autonomous operation, and I gave it plenty of advantages. Auto Browse works with all three of Google’s current model settings—Fast, Thinking, and Pro. I left it set to Pro and used Google tools where appropriate. Despite that, Auto Browse needed nudging or re-prompting in almost every test. This stuff won’t be useful until it can actually operate as an agent on your behalf. Right now, it’s more like babysitting an easily distracted robot. Many of the lost points come from Auto Browse being unable to use Google’s own products—it didn’t find the right emails in Gmail, couldn’t enter data in Google Sheets, and failed to understand YouTube Music’s interface (we feel you on that one, Auto Browse). The apparent inability of browser agents to monitor pages over time is also an issue. If a task involves more than a few minutes of waiting, it will probably fail or abort early. This feature is still in preview, but it’s widely available to anyone paying for Google’s AI. The company also seems to suggest it will roll out to non-paying users in the future. It can be neat to watch the browser navigate the web for you, but that’s the thing—you have to watch it. Too often, you have to re-prompt or tell the AI to continue with a task. Auto Browse can’t be trusted to get things right without supervision, at least not yet.

There is no shortage of thin, MagSafe-compatible power banks on the market. We've tested quite a few that work really well. But the Power Capsule -- and Twelve South's products more generally -- stand apart from the tide of Amazon products for their well-made, minimalist aesthetic.Nothing about this device looks cheap or like it's ticking down to an inevitable end in a landfill. It looks good, like a power bank ready for an adult's smartphone. That said, these aren't rugged devices made to withstand the elements. For that task, there are better options. Also: I opened a 9,000,000mAh power bank from eBay to learn the truth - here's what I sawThe Power Capsule is certainly one of the smallest power banks I've tested, just barely under four inches long, 2.78 inches wide, and 0.27 pounds. The outward face is coated in a cactus-leather textile emblazoned with a neutral, tasteful geometric pattern. The material itself feels like natural leather and comes in Dune or Slate colorways. Kyle Kucharski/ZDNETThe device supports pass-through charging, which means you can charge the bank while it's also charging your phone, providing 15W of power in a 5,000mAh or 10,000mAh capacity. The 5,000mAh bank has enough power for about one full charge of an iPhone, while the 10,000mAh model boasts about double that performance. Keep in mind these are rough estimates, and the device will naturally go further with an iPhone 12 than the massive battery in the iPhone 16 Pro Max.Also: I tested a solid-state portable battery for a week - now lithium-ion feels outdated Still, the bank will keep you topped up over the course of a day or two -- not necessarily as a main source of power for several days in a row. I've been using the Power Capsule for a few days now and can't get beyond two days when keeping my iPhone 13 charged. Luckily, the device charges quickly, with lights on the front indicating its current charge level. A few things to note: first, the magnetic connectors on these devices are strong, but they're not indestructible. While it's not often the charger comes completely loose, it's possible to unseat the device enough to interrupt charging. This issue occurred a few times during my testing while out on the town, especially while going in and out of pockets.Also: Why the most premium charging accessory for iPhone fans isn't made by AppleSecond, the Power Capsule does work with phone cases that support wireless charging, but not 100% of the time; the charging can be a little more finicky when used with a case. I have one from Hicasers, and sometimes the wireless charge wouldn't activate or would be interrupted, even when it had juice. ZDNET's buying adviceIf you're looking for a premium MagSafe power bank that doesn't look like a cheap Temu purchase, Twelve South's Power Capsule is a reasonably priced option that does what it advertises and looks good doing it. There's only a $10 difference between the 5,000mAh power bank and the 10,000mAh, so if you don't mind a slightly thicker device, you'll get twice the capacity. That said, the smaller power bank is significantly thinner, so unless you really need the extra oomph, I'd suggest the 5,000mAh model.

Close Home Tech Smartphones Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra vs. S25 Ultra: What worries me after years with Galaxy The Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra looks like another incremental upgrade. I just hope these rumored omissions aren't true. Written by Prakhar Khanna, Contributing WriterContributing Writer Feb. 12, 2026 at 3:52 a.m. PT Reviewed by Elyse Betters Picaro Prakhar Khanna/ZDNETFollow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra was one of the most reliable phones launched last year. It had a big, sharp screen with a unique anti-reflective coating, powerful performance, and versatile cameras. However, I couldn't use it full-time because of an ergonomically poor design and an aging telephoto camera. Also: Samsung confirms Galaxy S26 preorder deal for $900 off ahead of February UnpackedThere have been rumors pointing toward similar downsides for the Galaxy S26 Ultra. I'm concerned about Samsung's upcoming flagship phone. 1. Where's the telephoto camera upgrade? Kerry Wan/ZDNETAccording to ETNews, the Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra will have a 200MP primary camera, accompanied by a 50MP ultrawide lens, a 10MP 3x telephoto camera, and another 50MP 5x telephoto sensor. The 200MP camera is fully capable of shooting high-resolution images, but the 3x zoom camera is due for a big upgrade. Also: I changed 10 settings on my Samsung phone to significantly improve the user experienceSamsung has relied on the same sensor for 3x zoom capabilities for a couple of years now. It was weak last year, when Apple pushed the limits in videography with its 4x telephoto camera, and Chinese manufacturers had perfected portraits and macro shots with improved processing. If it is the same telephoto camera in 2026, it doesn't stand a chance against competitors. I hope Samsung updates the post-processing to improve the output from its 10MP sensor, but I'm not super optimistic. If the Galaxy S26 Ultra sticks with the same 3x telephoto camera, I'd advise more people to use the 200MP camera mode and crop photos later instead of zooming in on the viewfinder. 2. Please, just focus on the ergonomics Kerry Wan/ZDNETLast year, Samsung slashed the weight of its Galaxy S25 Ultra to 218 grams -- a big feat for a mainstream flagship phone, especially since none of the $1,000-plus phones from Apple or Google weigh less than 230 grams. Despite a lighter design, it was harder to use than the heavier Galaxy S24 Ultra, which wasn't too comfortable due to its sharp corners, and the Galaxy S23 Ultra before that. The on-paper weight can be misleading because an unergonomic design can render a phone difficult to use in day-to-day life. That is exactly what happened with the Galaxy S25 Ultra. Also: Why the Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra's biggest upgrade won't be its camera or processor for meSamsung gave its flagship phone a boxy design, which looks good, and I like it, but it forgot to taper the edges on each side. As a result, when you hold the phone, its sides dig into your palm. Both the Apple iPhone 17 Pro and Google Pixel 10 Pro XL do better in this regard. If the latest leaks are any indication, the Galaxy S26 Ultra could feature the same sharp, flat sides as before. According to a now-removed video shared by leaker Evan Blass, the upcoming Samsung phone could retain the boxy look with flat sides. It looks similar to the Galaxy S25 Ultra, and I cannot say for sure whether the edges on both sides have been tapered. If not, I will be disappointed because I need my phones to be comfortable to hold without adding a case. 3. I hope the S26 Ultra isn't more expensive Kerry Wan/ZDNETThe Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra is not guaranteed to get a price hike, but rumors are split on whether it is going to cost the same as its predecessor or be more expensive. Samsung could be facing pressure from component price hikes, but the Galaxy S25 Ultra already cost $1,300 at launch. To put things into perspective, $1,300 for the base version is more than Apple and Google's big flagship phones. While Samsung has doubled the storage to 512GB for the same price as part of launch offers, it is still in a tough spot. Modest upgrades, but new tech is promising Samsung recently teased a new display privacy feature debuting with the Galaxy S26 Ultra. There is no official name for the feature yet, but it is expected to be called Privacy Display -- and it could be a big deal for both regular consumers and business users. It could work similarly to a privacy screen protector, which prevents strangers from snooping on your private data in public. Also: Samsung Unpacked 2026: 5 biggest rumors I'm seeing on Galaxy S26 Ultra, Buds 4 Pro, moreThe Korean company is said to achieve this through pixel-level light control, adjusting its OLED emission so that light only shines toward the user when the display is viewed straight on. It won't reduce the phone's overall brightness or color depth, unlike a physical privacy screen protector. I am looking forward to it the most. If Samsung can make a comfortable-to-hold phone, the Galaxy S26 Ultra has a lot going for it, despite some modest upgrades on paper.

Once fully set up, it quickly becomes a wholly natural part of your working environment.TIRED1080p resolution offers limited usability. Most laptop users will require an extra AC outlet to power the monitors. Very bulky, heavy, and awkward to set up.Add-on displays like the portable monitor have been around for years, but aside from better resolution and clarity, the category hasn’t changed much since its introduction.Under-the-radar operation KYY aims to shake things up by suggesting that the path forward involves not making these devices better but giving you more of them. So, if two displays are good and three are great, what does four screens feel like?The Big, Big PicturePhotograph: Chris NullThe KYY X90G is a collapsible device that provides you with three extra screens, and while you can use it with anything that has a USB port, it’s specifically designed for connection to a laptop. The three 15.6-inch IPS LCD screens (each with a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels, non-touch) are all connected to a thick, central backing board via beefy hinges.KYY X90G 15.6-Inch Quad Portable Monitor ExtenderRating: 7/10$600 $480 at Amazon$700 at KYYOne folds out to the left, one to the right, and one upwards; your laptop (there’s room for up to a 17.3-inch machine) is meant to sit in the middle of this arrangement, providing the fourth screen in a quad-display setup. The screen on top can swivel back so that it faces away from the user, offering the potential to use that screen for presentation purposes (while still giving you three forward-facing screens to work on yourself). The panels have no audio capabilities.Fully extended, the thing is a monster, stretching nearly 46 inches (nearly 4 feet) from side to side and 18 inches vertically. With a weight of 6.4 pounds, it also adds significantly to your travel load, though it’s clearly not designed for use in situations where real mobility is required.Size isn’t the only challenge on the portability front: The KYY X90G also draws a significant amount of power—up to 30 watts. If your computer’s USB port can output that amount of wattage, the X90G can run via a single USB-C cable connection to one of the two ports on the backing board. Mine seemed to offer enough juice at first, but once I started turning the brightness up to something usable (and drawing more juice), the screens began to flicker and fail. Fortunately, KYY includes an extra USB-C cable and power adapter that, once connected to an outlet, ensured I ran into no further power consumption issues. That does, however, mean you’ll likely need access to two AC outlets for a typical laptop setup to work properly—another strike against attempting to fire all of this up at a Starbucks.Each screen includes its own hardware controls, allowing for individual configuration, a traditional three-button affair that launches a simple menu system whereby you can adjust brightness, color, and contrast, and fine-tune the positioning of the screen. The default brightness of 30 (out of 100) was far too dim for usability, but otherwise I found the factory settings to be workable. I tested the X90G with a Windows laptop, and it was simple to arrange the three screens around my central display in the Display settings control panel to extend my desktop in all directions.Resolution RestrictionsPhotograph: Chris NullIn today’s laptop world, 1080p resolution doesn’t get you far, and I found this to be the major limiting factor for the device, restricting the utility of the three extra screens due to the limited amount of content I could populate each of them with. Realistically, a minimum 1920 x 1200-pixel resolution is needed to make this extra screen real estate practical for knowledge work, though it’s fine for more casual content.KYY X90G 15.6-Inch Quad Portable Monitor ExtenderRating: 7/10$600 $480 at Amazon$700 at KYYPhysically arranging the panels can also be a bit of a challenge, particularly the two side wings. When fully opened, the screens align vertically with the backing board (and your laptop screen) and are flush with the tabletop, but since they don’t face the user, they’re awkward to work with. The better plan is to angle the side screens about 30 degrees so they point toward your face, but this alters the vertical alignment, forcing each screen into a weird diagonal with the outside edge kicked upward. It looks really odd, though I got used to this after a few hours of working with the system and was eventually able to look past it. While KYY could try adding another degree of freedom to the hinges on the side displays so they can swivel down into a level position, this is probably asking for a high risk of hinge failure.The X90G lists for a hefty $700, but it's available on Amazon for $600, and I've seen it discounted to $480. Once I started using my laptop with the screens, I found it hard to go back to working without them. The upper screen is easily the most useful of the trio. Even though its resolution is limited, it brings your most important work a lot closer to your eyeline, improving ergonomics significantly without the need for a stand. I mostly used the side screens for less critical work like chat sessions and web research, and left my email parked on my laptop’s built-in display, where the higher resolution was needed the most.While it’s not a device that I plan to travel with, it is something I have no doubt I will continue to use when working remotely (while parked in a single location) for multiple days at a time. Note to self: Pack a power strip too.KYY X90G 15.6-Inch Quad Portable Monitor ExtenderRating: 7/10$600 $480 at Amazon$700 at KYY$600 $480 at Amazon$700 at KYY"

YouTube access was also reportedly degraded, though it's not clear if the app has been completely removed. \nIn July 2025, a Russian lawmaker who regulates the IT industry said it's very likely that WhatsApp would be placed on a list of restricted software.

However, restrictions on Telegram haven't gone over well domestically, even among Putin's allies, as residents along Ukraine's borders have relied on it for drone and missile alerts. \"I am concerned that slowing Telegram could affect the flow of information, if the situation deteriorates,\" said the governor of one of those regions.  \nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/whatsapp-is-now-fully-blocked-in-russia-110953485.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Vinyl records are firmly back in rotation, but getting started does not have to mean spending a fortune or building a complicated hi-fi stack from day one. Whether you want a simple, all-in-one setup with built-in speakers or you are piecing together a more traditional system with a separate amplifier, the best record player is the one that fits how you listen at home.\nFor this guide, we focused on high-quality turntables under $600 that deliver a satisfying listening experience without unnecessary complexity. These picks cover everything from beginner-friendly automatic models to more audiophile-leaning decks that prioritize sound quality and upgrade potential, proving you do not need to jump into the high-end to enjoy vinyl properly.\nBest record players for 2026\n\n\n\n\n\nOther record players we tested\nAudio-Technica AT-LP60XBT\nThis is about as basic as it gets, unless you opt for the AT-LP60X which ditches the Bluetooth connectivity. This is a perfectly decent option for someone just getting into vinyl, but if you spend a little more for the AT-LP70X, you won’t be in quite as big of a hurry to upgrade once you surrender to the obsession.\nCambridge Audio Alva ST\nThe Alva ST has a refined design that made me want to keep it out in my living room longer than many of the models on this list. The controls are limited on the top to power and individual options for 33 and 45 RPM speeds. Everything else is on the back panel, including Bluetooth pairing and preamp buttons. To complete the look, Cambridge Audio opted for a 1mm aluminium top plate, which sits on an MDF plinth with a layer of EVA to absorb vibrations in between.\nWhile the overall audio performance on the Alva ST is warm and inviting, there is a lack of detail across genres. I’ve noticed albums don’t have a particularly wide soundstage, and songs lack their normal punch at times, so some sound compressed compared to when they’re played on other turntables. Additionally, the free swinging tone arm needs more resistance so it’s not so prone to dropping on a record immediately if it slips out of your fingers when you have the cueing lever down. Since this turntable is fully manual operation, I felt a bit of peril every time I went to lower the needle. (The price increased during testing for this guide.)\nDenon DP-300F\nDenon’s DP-300F is a mixed bag. On one hand, you get the convenience of fully automatic operation, dedicated speed and record size buttons and somewhat refined design. There are also some confounding decisions though, like the permanently affixed cables, the preamp switch being under the platter and the overall midrange build quality for a $500 turntable. The sound from the preamp and Denon’s cartridge has a clear lack of depth and detail that almost any model at this price should offer.\nHow to shop for a turntable\nThe first question you’ll need to ask yourself when looking for a turntable is how you plan to use it. Are you into vinyl for the ritual? If you simply like the concept of physical media, having to flip a record to finish it or the need to intentionally swap out an album when it’s done, that’s just fine. You probably can make do with a more affordable turntable since overall sound quality may not be a main concern. If you crave the warmth of analog sound, and you want the collection you’ve invested in to sound its best, you’ll need to consider something with better specs. \nYou’ll also need to account for where and how you’re going to listen to vinyl. Are you planning to connect this turntable to headphones or Bluetooth speakers? Do you have shelf or tower speakers you’re going to use? Are you willing to invest in a dedicated preamp or would you rather a new turntable come with one built in? All of these questions will impact your buying decision — even the Bluetooth codecs, if you’re going the wireless route.\nAutomatic, semi-auto and manual operation\nIf you’re just getting into vinyl, an automatic turntable will save you a lot of stress. These are the models that place the stylus for you — all you have to do is push a button. When you get to the end of the record, the turntable will also return the tonearm to its resting spot automatically. Or, if you need to stop your session mid-side, there’s a button for that too. \nSome turntables have semi-automatic operation. Maybe they can’t place the needle for you, but they do have an automatic stop when a side of a record is complete. This auto stop, which sometimes comes with an on/off switch, can prevent unnecessary wear on your stylus and vinyl. Plus, many turntables with automatic operation allow you to take control if you need to drop the stylus in a certain place (that’s not the beginning of the record) or if you have a die-cut vinyl (like the It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown soundtrack). \nThen there’s the fully manual option. Here, you’re solely responsible for placing the tonearm and taking it off when the music stops. A lot of turntables have a cue lever to assist with the process, and a lot of tonearms have a mechanism that lowers them slowly rather than violently dropping them on a record. This adds one more step to the ritual, and it’s one many purists prefer. \nPreamp\nThe biggest decision you’ll need to make in terms of a preamp is to decide if you want one built into your turntable or if you’d rather use a separate one. It can be very convenient, especially for beginners, to use a built-in component to amplify the signal from the turntable before it hits any speakers or headphones. The downside is that you’re left with what the company provides from the factory, so if you’re looking to upgrade, you’ll have to disable the preamp inside. On most turntables, there’s a switch that allows you to do this, so it’s no trouble. But, opting to skip the preamp on some models could save you money that could be invested elsewhere. \nA dedicated preamp typically uses higher-quality components and reduces noise by keeping internal parts properly separated. More robust models may even provide controls for things like tone or multiple inputs, while the basic options will simply allow you to plug in, play and forget it. If you’re after the best possible clarity and realism from your record collection, we’d recommend a dedicated preamp right from the start. \nRemovable cartridge/headshell\nThe next item you’ll want to consider is if the turntable you’re eyeing can be upgraded in the future. The best way to do this is by swapping out the cartridge. Most turntables allow you to do this but there are some that don’t, so you’ll need to pay attention to this detail. Upgrading the cartridge down the road is a great way to improve overall sound quality without having to buy a new turntable, new speakers or a new amp. \nBelt drive vs. direct drive\nThere are two main types of turntables: belt drive and direct drive. All of the models we tested for this guide are belt drive, which means there’s a thin belt that connects the platter to the motor to make the thing spin. Direct drive turntables are widely used by DJs and Technics was the first to make them. Here, the motor is directly under the platter and connected to it directly so the setup is less prone to wearing out. This is especially key when you’re doing things like scratching. Direct-drive turntables tend to be more expensive than their belt-driven counterparts.\nCounterweight and anti-skate control\nMost turntables will include a counterweight on the tonearm and some form of anti-skate control. Both of these help keep the stylus in place with the correct amount of pressure, all to ensure proper operation with minimal wear on your records. Sometimes the anti-skate elements are built into the tonearm while other models offer a dedicated dial on the surface of the plinth. The ability to adjust both of these can help you fine-tune the performance of your turntable over time, which may be necessary after upgrading the cartridge or other components. \nOther components to consider\nSome final items you’ll want to evaluate on a prospective turntable purchase include the materials used for the base (plinth), platter and even the feet. Cheaper turntables may be mostly plastic affairs while more expensive models can use solid MDF (medium-density fibreboard) for the plinth. A lot of turntables have aluminum platters with a felt pad while others may feature a thick acrylic version. And while entry-level turntables may have small, plastic feet, premium models come with larger, adjustable, rubberized feet for better vibration isolation. While some of these come down to personal preference — a frosted acrylic platter looks really nice — there are some performance boosts to be gained depending on how the company uses the components.\nHow we test turntables\nSince most turntables under $600 meet the criteria for entry-level through midrange, we tested every model with a set of Audio-Technica AT-SP3X powered speakers. These offer balanced sound for turntables with a 1.1-inch tweeter and 3-inch woofer in each unit. And at $269, they won’t break the bank if you need speakers for your new turntable and they’ll provide ample sound performance even if you spend more than our budget on a new deck.\nFor all of our test units that didn’t have a built-in preamp, we used the Fluance PA-10. At $100, it’s an affordable upgrade if you’re looking to bypass a turntable’s included components or if you’re looking to go more analog with your turntable purchase. There are no buttons or controls, just connect your turntable, speakers and ground wire (if you’re using one) and you’re ready to go. It’s simple, straightforward and inexpensive, so it’s a great option for beginners and more experienced vinyl collectors alike. \nIn terms of performance testing, we play a variety of genres on each turntable to evaluate sound quality. We also carefully examine the overall experience of putting a record on, setting the speed, placing the tonearm and more, which allows us to judge how well each turntable will work for users at different experience levels. Lastly, we take notes on design and components, comparing those elements from each turntable with our other test subjects to make our recommendations.\n\n\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/best-record-player-120000239.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Apple’s in-house studio will be producing the future seasons of Severance, according to Deadline. The company has reportedly acquired the show’s IP and all rights from its original studio, Fifth Season, back in December in a deal that was worth approximately $70 million. Fifth Season will remain as an executive producer, but Apple Studios will now be in charge of the show. Severance will be one of Apple’s marquee titles, alongside other shows like Owen Wilson’s Stick and Kristen Wiig’s Palm Royale. Apple also previously acquired sci-fi dystopian series Silo after its first season.\nDeadline reports that the show’s production costs were going beyond what Fifth Season could afford. The studio had already asked Apple for advances in the past and was considering moving the production from New York to Canada for bigger tax rebates. Apple has also apparently been helping Fifth Season not just with its budget, but also with securing advertisers. \nSeeing as the second season of Severance became the streamer’s most watched series, and Apple definitely has the money to keep the show going, the company decided to take over the series completely. It will allow Severance’s production to stay in New York without having to worry about budget constraints. Deadline says the series is expected to have four seasons, with the spinoffs showrunner Dan Erickson and director Ben Stiller are open to now being in the realm of possibility. \nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/entertainment/streaming/apple-acquires-severance-and-will-produce-future-seasons-in-house-092405747.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "As a former Mint user, I had to find a new budgeting app not too long ago. Intuit, parent company of Mint, shut down the service in March 2024, and prompted users to transition to its other financial app, Credit Karma. However, after testing Credit Karma myself, I found it to be a poor Mint replacement — that meant I needed to branch out and look elsewhere for a trusted app to track all of my financial accounts, monitor my credit score, follow a monthly spending plan and set goals like building a rainy-day fund and paying down my mortgage faster.\nI tried out Mint's top competitors in the hopes that I'd be able to find a new budgeting app that could handle all of my financial needs. Hopefully my journey can help you find the best budgeting app for you and your money as well.\n \nBest budget apps of 2026\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \nOther budgeting apps we tested\n \nPocketGuard\n \nPocketGuard used to be a solid free budget tracker, but the company has since limited its “free” version to just a free seven-day trial. Now, you’ll have to choose between two plans once the trial is over: a $13 monthly plan or a $75 annual plan. When I first tested it, I found it to be more restricted than NerdWallet, but still a decent option. The main overview screen shows you your net worth, total assets and debts; net income and total spending for the month; upcoming bills; a handy reminder of when your next paycheck lands; any debt payoff plan you have; and any goals. Like some other apps, including Quicken Simplifi, PocketGuard promotes an “after bills” approach, where you enter all of your recurring bills, and then PocketGuard shows you what’s left, and that’s what you’re supposed to be budgeting: your disposable income.\n \nAlthough PocketGuard’s UI is easy enough to understand, it lacks polish. The “accounts” tab is a little busy, and doesn’t show totals for categories like cash or investments. Seemingly small details like weirdly phrased or punctuated copy occasionally make the app feel janky. More than once, it prompted me to update the app when no updates were available. The web version, meanwhile, feels like the mobile app blown up to a larger format and doesn’t take advantage of the extra screen real estate. Ultimately, now that the free tier is gone, it just doesn’t present the same value proposition as it once did.\n \nHow we test budgeting apps\n \nBefore I dove in and started testing out budgeting apps, I had to do some research. To find a list of apps to try out, I consulted trusty ol’ Google (and even trustier Reddit); read reviews of popular apps on the App Store; and also asked friends and colleagues what budget tracking apps (or other budgeting methods) they might be using for money management. Some of the apps I found were free and these, of course, show loads of ads (excuse me, “offers”) to stay in business. But most of the available apps require paid subscriptions, with prices typically topping out around $100 a year, or $15 a month. (Spoiler: My top pick is cheaper than that.)\n \nAll of the services I chose to test needed to do several things: import all of your account data into one place; offer budgeting tools; and track your spending, net worth and credit score. Except where noted, all of these apps are available for iOS, Android and on the web.\n \nOnce I had my shortlist of six apps, I got to work setting them up. For the sake of thoroughly testing these apps, I made a point of adding every account to every budgeting app, no matter how small or immaterial the balance. What ensued was a veritable Groundhog Day of two-factor authentication. Just hours of entering passwords and one-time passcodes, for the same banks half a dozen times over. Hopefully, you only have to do this once.\n \nBudgeting app FAQs\n \nWhat is Plaid and how does it work?\n \nEach of the apps I tested uses the same underlying network, called Plaid, to pull in financial data, so it’s worth explaining what it is and how it works. Plaid was founded as a fintech startup in 2013 and is today the industry standard in connecting banks with third-party apps. Plaid works with over 12,000 financial institutions across the US, Canada and Europe. Additionally, more than 8,000 third-party apps and services rely on Plaid, the company claims.\n \nTo be clear, you don’t need a dedicated Plaid app to use it; the technology is baked into a wide array of apps, including all of the budgeting apps listed in this guide. Once you find the “add an account” option in whichever one you’re using, you’ll see a menu of commonly used banks. There’s also a search field you can use to look yours up directly. Once you find yours, you’ll be prompted to enter your login credentials. If you have two-factor authentication set up, you’ll need to enter a one-time passcode as well.\n \nAs the middleman, Plaid is a passthrough for information that may include your account balances, transaction history, account type and routing or account number. Plaid uses encryption, and says it has a policy of not selling or renting customer data to other companies. However, I would not be doing my job if I didn’t note that in 2022 Plaid was forced to pay $58 million to consumers in a class action suit for collecting “more financial data than was needed.” As part of the settlement, Plaid was compelled to change some of its business practices.\n \nIn a statement provided to Engadget, a Plaid spokesperson said the company continues to deny the allegations underpinning the lawsuit and that “the crux of the non-financial terms in the settlement are focused on us accelerating workstreams already underway related to giving people more transparency into Plaid’s role in connecting their accounts, and ensuring that our workstreams around data minimization remain on track.”\n \nWhy did Mint shut down?\n \nWhen parent company Intuit announced in December 2023 that it would shut down Mint, it did not provide a reason why it made the decision to do so. It did say that Mint's millions of users would be funneled over to its other finance app, Credit Karma. \"Credit Karma is thrilled to invite all Minters to continue their financial journey on Credit Karma, where they will have access to Credit Karma’s suite of features, products, tools and services, including some of Mint’s most popular features,\" Mint wrote on its product blog. In our testing, we found that Credit Karma isn't an exact replacement for Mint — so if you're still looking for a Mint alternative, you have some decent options.\n \nWhat about Rocket Money?\n \nRocket Money is another free financial app that tracks spending and supports things like balance alerts and account linking. If you pay for the premium tier, the service can also help you cancel unwanted subscriptions. We did not test it for this guide, but we'll consider it in future updates.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/apps/best-budgeting-apps-120036303.html?src=rss",

Close Home Tech Smartphones Mobile Accessories I've tested dozens of earbuds over the last year - these blow them all out of the water The Denon PerL Pro surpassed my expectations with audiophile-grade sound right out of the box. Written by Jack Wallen, Contributing WriterContributing Writer Feb. 11, 2026 at 6:45 p.m. PT Jack Wallen/ZDNETWhen it comes to audio, I can be incredibly picky. Like most audiophiles, I have very particular wants and needs before I'll proclaim a pair of headphones a viable option. Because of that, most earbuds fail to stand up to my demands. I've had a few that were passable but rarely has a pair of wireless earbuds knocked off my metaphorical socks.At least, all of this was true until I tried the Denon PerL Pro. Also: My simple tweaks that bring dead-sounding headphones back to life - Sony and Bose includedIf high-quality sound is what you're looking for in an earbud, and you have the cash for a $249 pair, these babies are hard to beat. I'd go so far as to say they rival my go-to over-the-ear wired headphones, the V-Moda Crossfade 3. ZDNET Recommends Denon PerL Pro These earbuds are best in class and can be had for $349 on Amazon. details View at Amazon When I received the Denon PerL Pro earbuds, I was skeptical. I've gone through so many pairs of earbuds (none of which wind up in my \"headphone rotation list\"), and I tend to shrug them all off in favor of my go-to pairs (unless I'm exercising, at which point I go for my Mojawa Run Plus bone conducting headphones).That all changes now.Also: Why I still recommend the AirPods Pro 2 in 2026 - especially at this priceNo, I won't be using the Denon PerL Pro earbuds for exercise because these things are too costly and too good for sweating. But when I want to hear accurate, rich, and elegant sound on the go, these earbuds are exactly what I want.My experienceI always judge earbuds (and headphones) without using any app to customize the sound. I want to hear the music exactly with the manufacturer's default settings, so I can get an idea of what the pure sound is from the hardware.With some earbuds, that results in an experience that isn't nearly up to my standards. However, in the case of the Denon PerL Pro, the manufacturer nailed it. As soon as I connected them to my Pixel Pro 8 (which was just a matter of taking them out of the case and walking through the automatic connection prompt on the phone), I opened Spotify and played my default song for testing such devices: Rush's \"Tom Sawyer\". Also: Need a rugged Android tablet for your business? I tested one that looks great and lasts all dayHad you been watching me, you would have seen the huge grin on my face. I had just come across a pair of earbuds that made me a believer, and it took all of four bars of music to impress me. I let one of the greatest rock songs ever written continue and, by the time it came to a close, I was sold.In case it isn't clear: the Denon PerL Pro earbuds are truly a work of art. The sound is accurate, vibrant, spacious, and hits all the right notes. The bass is perfect, the midrange subtle but sharp, and the highs are spectacular. What is truly remarkable about these earbuds is that you don't have to use the app to customize the sound, as it's that good out of the box.Also: How to restart your Android phone without using the power button: 2 easy waysAlthough you won't find the bass of the PerL Pro's to be as thunderous as some of the competition, it's far cleaner and accurate. Out of the box, the EQ on these earbuds is spot on for every genre of music I tried (prog rock, metal, classical, choral, 80s, rock, shoegaze, and pop). In some instances (such as with Rush's \"Moving Pictures\" album, the sound was so crisp and agile that I was certain it was coming from my turntable. Just note, that as with every pair of earbuds, fit is crucial; you want to get the best seal possible with the ear tips. I've always found foam ear tips to be far superior but have a much shorter lifespan. The silicon tips might not create the best seal, but they will last exponentially longer. ZDNET's buying adviceThe Denon PerL Pro earbuds have not only raised the bar for all earbuds, they've set the standard, and every other pair I use going forward will have to stand up to what the Denon PerL Pro earbuds deliver. It really comes down to this: If you have the money and are looking for sound that shouldn't be possible with an earbud, the Denon PerL Pro earbuds are the ones to buy. Forget about anything Apple or Google has to offer and do your ears (and soul) a favor with a pair of earbuds that will light up your brain wit off-the-charts sound.Also: My AirPods wouldn't stay in my ears - these $20 eartips brought me freedomDenon PerL Pro tech specsMasimo AAT delivers personalized sound based on each individual's otoacoustic emissions, which are produced by the inner ear.

It got another one Wednesday with the removal of the Crew Access Arm used by astronauts to board their rides to space. Construction workers first carved the footprint for the launch pad from the Florida wetlands more than 60 years ago. NASA used the site to launch Saturn V rockets dispatching astronauts to the Moon, then converted the pad for the Space Shuttle program. The last shuttle flight lifted off from Pad 39A in 2011, and the agency leased the site to SpaceX for use as the departure point for the company’s Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets. SpaceX started launching from Pad 39A in 2017, then installed a new Crew Access Arm on the pad’s tower the following year, replacing the aging shuttle-era arm that connected to the hatches of NASA’s orbiters. SpaceX added the new arm ahead of the first test flight of the company’s human-rated Crew Dragon spacecraft in 2019. Astronauts started using the pathway, suspended more than 200 feet above the pad surface, beginning with the first crew flight on a Dragon spacecraft in 2020. Now, Pad 39A is undergoing another facelift in preparation for launches of SpaceX’s powerful Starship rocket. Construction of a new launch tower for Starship is well along about 1,000 feet east of the existing tower at Pad 39A, still inside the facility’s circular perimeter. SpaceX aims to launch the first Starship flight from Kennedy Space Center later this year, following a series of flights from the company’s Starbase test site in South Texas. With the arrival of Starship, SpaceX is suspending Falcon 9 flights from Pad 39A in favor of launches from nearby Pad 40, located a few miles to the south at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, on property leased from the US Space Force. Kiko Dontchev, SpaceX’s vice president of launch, wrote on X in December that the decision will allow teams to “put full focus on Falcon Heavy launches and ramping Starship from the Cape.” Astronauts are seen walking across the Crew Access Arm before boarding SpaceX’s Crew Dragon spacecraft.

Credit: NASA/Joel Kowsky Au revoir, not adieu SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy, primarily used to launch payloads for the Space Force and NASA, will continue flying from Pad 39A, the only site currently outfitted to accommodate the triple-core rocket. The next Falcon Heavy launch is scheduled for no earlier than April, with no more than a handful of flights per year planned for the rest of the 2020s. Ground teams installed a Crew Access Arm at Pad 40 ahead of the first crew launch there in 2024. All future Crew Dragon flights will now depart from Pad 40 for the foreseeable future, beginning with the launch of the Crew-12 mission to the International Space Station later this week. “It’s great to have two launch pads off the Florida coast. For our manifest going forward, we’re planning to launch most of our Falcon 9 launches off of Space Launch Complex 40. That will include all Dragon missions going forward,” said Lee Echerd, a SpaceX senior mission manager for human spaceflight. “That will allow our Cape team to focus at 39A on Falcon Heavy launches and hopefully our first Starship launches later this year.” Pad 40 has been the primary Falcon 9 launch site for most of the rocket’s history, while Pad 39A provided a location for crew launches and an augmentation to support SpaceX’s growing launch cadence. But there are signs the Falcon 9 launch cadence, which reached 165 missions last year, may be peaking as the company turns its attention to Starship. And SpaceX has steadily reduced the time it takes to reconfigure Pad 40 between launches, cutting the turnaround time to less than 48 hours. If needed, SpaceX officials said they could reinstall the crew arm for Dragon missions launching from Pad 39A. Repairs required Bill Gerstenmaier, SpaceX’s vice president of build and flight reliability, said there’s another pressing reason for removing the crew arm at Pad 39A. The bearings that connect the arm to the launch pad’s tower need repairs. “To physically get access to those, the arm needs to be removed,” Gerstenmaier said. “Those bearings have to come out and they have to be reinstalled. We’ll do that work at the Kennedy Space Center. And the intent there is, we don’t need to put the arm back up … When we get a call-up for a mission and we have to go fly a mission, if it requires that, we have plenty of time to get the arm back up.” SpaceX has continued launching Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets from Pad 39A amid the nearby construction work to prepare for Starship flights. “That doesn’t impact our ability to launch from the pad,” Gerstenmaier said. That could change as SpaceX begins testing and launching Starships from Kennedy Space Center. Starship launch operations may routinely force the closure of Pad 39A to personnel. “The right thing to do is get those bearings replaced in the environment on the ground, make some upgrades to them, and then we’ll be ready to go and put the arm back up when it’s time to go fly, if we need to go fly,” Gerstenmaier said.

Close Home Tech Smartphones Mobile Accessories I extended my AirTag's battery life to 10 years with this $15 accessory - how it works The Elevation Lab Time Capsule fixed my biggest problem with AirTags. Now if only it weren't a tank. Written by Adrian Kingsley-Hughes, Senior Contributing EditorSenior Contributing Editor Feb. 11, 2026 at 6:00 p.m. PT Reviewed by Elyse Betters Picaro Elevation Lab Time Capsule ZDNET's key takeaways It boosts battery life up to a decade. It is water and dustproof. However, it does add bulk to the sleek AirTag. $15.98 at Amazon Follow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.Apple AirTags have revolutionized every aspect of my life. From finding my keys and wallet in the morning to keeping an eye on my luggage while traveling, not a day goes by that I don't open the Find My app to locate something I've misplaced or check that something is still where it should be.Also: I tested a solid-state portable battery for a week - now lithium-ion feels old schoolBut I have two bugbears about AirTags. First, the shape is odd and doesn't lend itself to direct attachment. The second issue is the one- to two-year battery life. The battery life issue is particularly frustrating, and I constantly have a few AirTags needing new batteries. I've now resorted to buying CR2032 coin batteries by the dozen.Well, a company called ElevationLabs has solved both of these issues with the TimeCapsule 10-year battery case. As the name suggests, this is a case for an AirTag that can power it for up to a decade. ZDNET RECOMMENDS ElevationLabs TimeCapsule 10-Year battery case A way to replace the CR2032 button cell in the AirTag with two AA lithium batteries, to boost battery life from a year or so to a decade. details View at Amazon Tough and IP69-ratedThe case is made from tough, fiber-reinforced composite construction, complete with a gasket that seals it to an IP69 rating (completely dust-tight and able to withstand high-pressure water jets and steam cleaning), along with quality CNC-machined fasteners. An Allen key is even supplied for assembly.You just need to add an AirTag and a couple of AA batteries. Just add two AA Energizer Ultimate Lithium batteries. Adrian Kingsley-Hughes/ZDNETSpeaking of batteries, ElevationLabs recommends Energizer Ultimate Lithium batteries, and I second that recommendation. These batteries offer excellent longevity, stable power output, and in my many years of using them, I've never experienced a leak. Avoid using cheap alkaline batteries for a project like this, as you run the risk of damaging both the AirTag and the case if the battery bursts and leaks its corrosive goo everywhere.Assembling is easyGet everything ready, open the AirTag, and set the battery and battery cover aside. Fit the batteries into the case, place the AirTag on top of the metal power plate, pop the cover on, and screw it down. Assembly is easy. Adrian Kingsley-Hughes/ZDNETA word on the screws: They only need to be snug enough to gently compress the gasket. I suggest working slowly, tightening one screw at a time until they are hand-tight. There's no need to go all beast mode on them. Snug down the fasteners, there's no need to overtighten! Adrian Kingsley-Hughes/ZDNETI was curious about the overall quality of the TimeCapsule, its dust and water resistance rating, and whether having the AirTag in a case reduces its effectiveness.The build quality is exceptional, and the fit and finish are excellent. The case is tough and completely water- and dust-proof. I've dropped it and trodden on it without any concerns.Also: The best portable power stations you can buyAs for the range of the AirTag in and out of the case, I tested this in the narrow streets of Marrakesh and found no difference in the detection range or location accuracy. I did notice that the case muffles the speaker a little, but it was still audible over the hustle and bustle of the environment.ZDNET's buying adviceApple AirTags are great, but the ElevationLabs TimeCapsule 10-year battery case enhances their functionality for a variety of applications. While the AirTag is perfect for attaching to keys or concealing in a wallet or purse, the TimeCapsule is ideal for use in luggage, camera cases, toolboxes, vehicles, or similar situations where the extra size is not an issue.A single TimeCapsule costs $15 (at the time of writing), while a four-pack is $35, so opting for the larger pack is a no-brainer if you want the best value.The only concern I have is that Apple could change the AirTag's form factor at some point soon. Therefore, my advice is to have AirTags ready for all the TimeCapsule cases you purchase and perhaps keep a few spares on hand.Featured reviews I spent weeks with Alexa on the Echo Show 11, and it was awesome (until I started fact-checking) Sony LinkBuds Clip vs. Bose QuietComfort Open: This model wins big I replaced my bedroom TV with a $180 Roku projector - and don't regret it I found the Lenovo ThinkPad to rule them all - and its modular RAM changes everything I spent weeks with Alexa on the Echo Show 11, and it was awesome (until I started fact-checking) Sony LinkBuds Clip vs. Bose QuietComfort Open: This model wins big I replaced my bedroom TV with a $180 Roku projector - and don't regret it I found the Lenovo ThinkPad to rule them all - and its modular RAM changes everything Editorial standards Show Comments Log In to Comment Community Guidelines Related AirTag 2 vs. AirTag 1: I compared both Bluetooth trackers, and the winner is not so obvious Here's a portable power bank that's actually worth its high price - especially if you travel Why lithium batteries in our phones and laptops keep failing us - and how to lower that risk"

    "full_text": "Innovation Home Innovation What is Bluetooth 6.0? How the latest standard is changing audio right before our eyes Bluetooth 6 is gaining traction in audio, but its best features ultimately lie in new hardware. Written by Jada Jones, EditorEditor Feb. 11, 2026 at 5:31 p.m. PT Jada Jones/ZDNETFollow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.ZDNET's key takeawaysThe Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG) released Bluetooth 6.0 in Sept. 2024.Its notable features pave the way for universal device tracking, lower latency, and more efficient wireless connections.Although newly released smartphones have adopted the new wireless standard, headphones and earbuds have not yet caught up.Bluetooth and headphones go together like peanut butter and jelly; it's the technology that allows you to go wireless, but wireless listening isn't its only characteristic. Bluetooth versions are responsible for audio compression and transmission, as well as latency and connection stability. As the technology advances, you can look forward to getting more out of your headphones and earbuds.Also: I spoke with Bluetooth reps about the future of connected audio, and it's cooler than I expectedDespite the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG) releasing the Bluetooth 6.2 core specification in late 2025, many headphones released as recently as this year still feature Bluetooth 5.3 or 5.4. Not every specification delivers mind-blowing features, and new features for end users aren't guaranteed by Bluetooth versions alone.Still, there are connectivity, latency, and performance improvements to look forward to within the 6.0+ specifications. This year, several smartphones are debuting with Bluetooth 6. As you expect to see more Bluetooth 6 products in 2026, here are its most notable features and what they could mean for you.Connection efficiencyBluetooth 6 introduces improvements to how Bluetooth-enabled devices find and pair with one another, creating faster and smoother device pairing. Hopefully, this improvement will be most noticeable to people who like Bluetooth multipoint, a feature that allows one Bluetooth device to save multiple connections and switch between them.Also: These Windows 11 PCs are getting a free Bluetooth upgrade - here's how to use it properlyIf you currently use Bluetooth multipoint, you may notice it's sometimes unreliable, glitchy, and frustrating, especially when switching a pair of headphones from a smartphone to a laptop or tablet. Bluetooth 6 features Decision-Based Advertising Filtering and Monitoring Advertisers, which improve interoperability and enable faster reconnections to previously paired Bluetooth devices. Jada Jones/ZDNETBluetooth's use of the term \"advertising\" has little to do with influencing your buying decisions and more to do with how devices broadcast their presence within a Bluetooth network. With improved advertising methods in Bluetooth 6, your headphones broadcast smaller, low-power signals to your devices to announce their ability to connect. Then, your phone can easily discover this connection for instant pairing without using much battery power.Also: Your Sony headphones just got a useful Bluetooth upgrade with the latest software patchYour headphones and smartphone must have Bluetooth 6.0+ compatibility to take advantage of these features. Fortunately, many smartphones released in 2025, such as the Google Pixel 10 lineup and Apple iPhone 17 family, are equipped with Bluetooth 6. You'll just need to wait for headphone manufacturers to catch up.Latency gainsOlder Bluetooth versions experienced issues with audio/video latency, where a delay occurred between the audio you hear and the video you watch. Although more recent Bluetooth versions reduced latency for video-watching, as mobile gaming and AR/VR continue to evolve, so does the way we experience audio via Bluetooth. Jada Jones/ZDNETAs a result, Bluetooth offers improvements to the Isochronous Adaptation Layer (ISOAL), which is responsible for transmitting real-time data, such as audio. Enhancing this technology optimizes multiple Bluetooth layers, enabling faster transmission speeds and larger data transfers tailored to your audio needs.Also: I wore Google's upcoming Android XR smart glasses, and it's a future I'd actually want to live inThus, mobile gamers may not need to wire their headphones or earbuds to their device for unnoticeable latency. Additionally, console and PC gamers may find more flexibility in their everyday headphones and earbuds, finding that they can handle the audio demands of single-player games.Universal device trackingBluetooth Channel Sounding is a highly anticipated feature of Bluetooth 6, thanks to its potential to democratize Find My Device technology. It offers centimeter precision for device tracking, allowing users to locate devices, such as headphones, that are not equipped with an ultra-wideband (UWB) chip.Also: I've used Samsung's Galaxy TriFold, but this upcoming model may be more enticing in 2026UWB chips also offer precise device location, but they are more expensive and more complicated to integrate into every device's motherboard. Earbuds like Apple's AirPods include a UWB chip, which enables them to be detected within your Find My network. However, most headphones don't have a UWB chip, so Bluetooth aims to offer Channel Sounding as an alternative solution. Jada Jones/ZDNETChannel Sounding utilizes Phase-based Ranging (PBR) and Round-trip Time (RTT) technologies to transmit and calculate the distance and direction between two Bluetooth devices. Given that Channel Sounding operates on Bluetooth's Low Energy (LE) network, and most device chips are already compatible with Bluetooth, the need for UWB chips in headphones and earbuds significantly decreases.Also: This Bluetooth Auracast receiver made me take my home theater setup much more seriouslyWith Channel Sounding, your smartphone from one manufacturer could locate your earbuds from another manufacturer, provided both devices are equipped with Bluetooth 6 or higher. There aren't many mainstream headphones and earbuds available in the US with Bluetooth 6, but this will likely change in 2026. Jada Jones/ZDNETThe adoption of newer wireless technologies is typically slower for headphones and earbuds compared to smartphones. Case in point: the iPhone 17 has Bluetooth 6, but the AirPods Pro 3 have Bluetooth 5.4. Also: I tested Sony and Bose's best headphones for months - how my buying advice has changed in 2026However, you shouldn't expect Apple to adopt these technologies anytime soon, as the company prefers its proprietary wireless technologies. The latest real-world applications of Bluetooth's innovations are easier to use with Google's Pixel devices. Earlier this year, Google expanded Bluetooth Auracast support to more smartphones, headphones, earbuds, and hearing aids, enabling users to share audio with other devices that also support the Bluetooth standard. So, if you're in the US and want to be an early adopter of Bluetooth's latest technologies, an Android phone is the way to go.When will I get these features?Implementing the latest features is up to manufacturers' discretion. For example, Bluetooth LE Audio requires a device to have Bluetooth 5.2, but several devices with that version don't support it. That decision is up to manufacturers, but as newer Bluetooth technologies gain more industry adoption, you'll see them show up in consumer devices, slowly but surely.Another example is Channel Sounding, which received significant fanfare when the Bluetooth SIG announced it within Bluetooth 6. As of early 2026, several smartphones support Bluetooth 6 but do not mention Channel Sounding. It's possible these devices have the hardware to support Channel Sounding, and could receive it in an over-the-air software or firmware update in the future. Also: Why your next pair of headphones will look very different - and your speakers, tooAs a result, the Bluetooth SIG encourages consumers not to get too excited about a device's Bluetooth version alone, as devices with the latest Bluetooth features will likely advertise them. So, if you see a device with Bluetooth 5.4 but no mention of Bluetooth LE Audio or with Bluetooth 6 and no mention of Channel Sounding, assume those devices aren't compatible with those features.Featured Your PC's critical security certificates may be about to expire - how to check 5 Linux servers that let you ditch the public cloud and reclaim your privacy - for free Is spyware hiding on your phone?

Close Home Tech Smartphones Mobile Accessories I opened a 9,000,000mAh power bank from eBay to learn the truth - here's what I saw I often get asked about cheap power banks with hard-to-believe claims. Well, I bought one and tested it. Written by Adrian Kingsley-Hughes, Senior Contributing EditorSenior Contributing Editor Feb. 11, 2026 at 5:30 p.m. PT Bold claims! Adrian Kingsley-Hughes/ZDNETFollow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.A power bank boasting a massive capacity of 9 million milliamp hours (mAh) that fits in the palm of your hand, all for just a little over $10, sounds too good to be true, doesn't it? Well, you know what they say.A reader brought this listing to my attention, questioning the validity of such bold claims. Although I harbored significant doubts, I decided to investigate further. All in the name of science, of course. Also: 10 DIY gadgets I never leave out of my toolkit (and why each one earns its spot)First, let's put that 9 million mAh claim into perspective. The $150 Anker PowerCore 24K has a capacity of 24,000 mAh, and it's quite a sizable power bank, weighing in at 1.3 pounds. To achieve a capacity of 9 million mAh, I'd need to spend over $35,000 on 375 PowerCore 24K power banks, and that's certainly not something I'd want to carry around -- nor would it fit in the palm of my hand.So, I ordered one of these purportedly massive-capacity power banks and waited a few days for delivery.Here's what I received: This definitely doesn't look like a 9,000,000 mAh power bank. Adrian Kingsley-Hughes/ZDNETSurprisingly, the packaging lacked any bold claims about the promised, yet unrealistic, capacity. Additionally, the plethora of typos on the package didn't inspire confidence in the product.Also: This thumb-sized accessory gave my old PC an instant speed boost (and twice the storage)The power bank's dead state on arrival also didn't improve my first impressions. Even worse, despite my attempts to charge it, nothing worked. It was completely unresponsive out of the box. The power bank was totally dead. Adrian Kingsley-Hughes/ZDNETMaybe I could fall back on the \"warranty.\" I doubt it. My \"warranty certificate.\" Adrian Kingsley-Hughes/ZDNETIt was time to roll the dice and take it apart to see what was inside. At this point, my money was on even more disappointment. Since I was prying into a power bank, I didn't want to use my trusty metal spudger, so instead, I turned to a safer plastic tool.Then, to both my surprise and shock, the power bank blinked into life for a few seconds while I was poking inside it. Poking inside the power bank brought it to life, even if only for a few seconds. Adrian Kingsley-Hughes/ZDNETAfter a little bit of force -- sometimes an unreasonable amount -- the case popped open and I could see what the problem was. One of the battery wires was disconnected. Not only did this account for why it wasn't working, but it also presented a danger of short-circuiting and even fire.Also: I tried a vertical charging tower in my home office - it was so good that I bought 3 more Well that's why it didn't work. The red wire was just floating about! Adrian Kingsley-Hughes/ZDNETI took a closer look at the batteries. They were all no-name 18650 lithium-ion cells, and I measured their capacity to be about 2,000 mAh. I suspect these may be old \"recycled\" cells or possibly seconds, as I'd expect the capacity of even a cheap 18,650 cell to be about 2,300 mAh. Also: Should you still buy rechargeable batteries in 2026? These USB-C ones say yesThis means the entire pack had a capacity of 6,000 mAh, a far cry from the 9,000,000 mAh that it advertised. These 18650 cells are likely to be old \"recycled\" cells or seconds. Adrian Kingsley-Hughes/ZDNETNow, to be honest, this is ultimately what I was expecting. Exaggerated claims dupe buyers into buying poor-quality power banks made from cheap, poorly assembled parts. If you're looking for a cheap power bank, I'd say throw an extra ten bucks into the purchase and get yourself this Baseus 10000mAh for $20. That way, you're getting a good quality power bank that delivers what it promises, will give you several years of service, and won't be a potential fire hazard.Featured reviews I spent weeks with Alexa on the Echo Show 11, and it was awesome (until I started fact-checking) Sony LinkBuds Clip vs. Bose QuietComfort Open: This model wins big I replaced my bedroom TV with a $180 Roku projector - and don't regret it I found the Lenovo ThinkPad to rule them all - and its modular RAM changes everything I spent weeks with Alexa on the Echo Show 11, and it was awesome (until I started fact-checking) Sony LinkBuds Clip vs. Bose QuietComfort Open: This model wins big I replaced my bedroom TV with a $180 Roku projector - and don't regret it I found the Lenovo ThinkPad to rule them all - and its modular RAM changes everything Editorial standards Show Comments Log In to Comment Community Guidelines Related I tested popular 'power-savers' on the market - here's the only one that isn't a scam 3 Apple devices you shouldn't buy this month, and 10 I recommend Should you still buy rechargeable batteries in 2026?

Look closely at the port -- do you see a color? It turns out that it actually means something. There's a standardized color scheme that communicates information about that device's capabilities.Mind blown? If you never noticed this, you're not alone. Most USB devices work fine on any compatible port, but they may not be optimized for optimal performance.

This tiny tester tells you which ones actually work as advertised Despite the fact that they share a universal port shape, all USB-A and USB-C devices are not created equal, with potentially very different transfer speeds, power transfer, and generations of similar devices. Even two USB-C ports right next to each other on the same laptop could have very different capabilities when it comes to data transfer speed and power delivery. Let's take a look at what they mean. What your USB port color meansThere are seven major color that indicate a device's generation and the data transfer speeds you can expect. If you have a rare device with a color not listed here, let me know in the comments. Black: Denoting USB 2.0, this is the second-most-common you'll see on devices of all types, supporting speeds of up to 480 Mbps.White: These are first-generation devices -- USB 1.x -- with the slowest potential transfer speeds that don't typically exceed 12 Mbps. They're also among the most common, found on devices that don't require data transfer or high-power delivery.Yellow: These ports can support either USB 2.0 or 3.0, and are \"always on\", meaning they can supply power even when the device they're connected to is off.Orange: Like yellow, but with support for USB 3.0. Always on. You might see these on your pair of headphones. Blue: Supporting USB 3.0 SuperSpeed technology and above, blue ports identify a device capable of fast data transfer: up to 5 Gbps (that's 5,000 Mbps) -- a significant jump from previous generations. Besides laptops, you'll see blue ports on thumb drives and external storage.Teal: Just like blue, but denoted as USB 3.1, supporting faster transfer speeds of up to 10 Gbps.Red: These are the newest and fastest devices available, categorized as USB 3.1 Generation 2 and USB 3.2. They support another significant increase in data transfer speeds -- up to 10-20 Gbps. Red USB ports are also always on. Blue USB-A ports indicate transfer speeds of up to 5 Gbps. Kyle Kucharski/ZDNETThe colors on your laptop's USB ports can also indicate at a glance which USB generation it supports. For example, the Acer Chromebook Plus Spin 514 features two identical USB-A 3.2 ports, capable of transferring data at speeds of up to 5 Gbps. If your laptop's USB ports don't have a color, it simply means the manufacturer chose not to use a color for design or budget reasons. When buying a new laptop, consider the speeds your USB ports support, as this is one aspect that most consumers tend not to investigate closely. Lower-priced or older laptops may have ports with more limited speeds, while newer laptops may forgo USB-A connectivity altogether in favor of faster USB-C ports. Also: What is Thunderbolt, and how is it different from USB-C?In that vein, USB-C ports can also have their own colors, but they're a little more specialized. Most USB-C ports are differentiated between standard connectivity with USB 2.0 (common in older laptops, with speeds of up to 480 Mbps) and 3x, which supports speeds of up to 10-20 Gbps. A step above standard USB-C are Thunderbolt ports, often marked with the Thunderbolt icon next to the port itself, which support speeds of up to 40 Gbps. These ports support some of the fastest USB transfer speeds available on the market, and you'll see them on high-end laptops. USB 4 is one of the newest and most powerful technologies available, with select laptops currently supporting this technology. The MacBook Pro M4 is one such example, with speeds up to 120 Gbps. USB 4 and Thunderbolt ports are backward compatible, so they have no problem running slower devices when plugged in.The bottom lineSo what does all this mean for you? I recommend looking at your laptop's spec sheet to determine the differences (if any) between the USB ports on your laptop. If one of them is faster than the other, it will be specified, and you can expect better performance by connecting the right devices to the corresponding ports.

John Timmer – Feb 11, 2026 7:02 pm | 152 Credit: Laura Hedien Credit: Laura Hedien Text settings Story text Size Small Standard Large Width * Standard Wide Links Standard Orange * Subscribers only Learn more Minimize to nav On Wednesday, a fossil-fuel lobbying group called the Washington Coal Club awarded President Trump a trophy that named him the “Undisputed Champion of Clean, Beautiful Coal.” Trump took advantage of the opportunity to take his latest shot at reviving the fortunes of the US’s most polluting source of electricity: an executive order that would make the military buy it. Coal is the second most expensive source of power for the US grid, eclipsed by gas, wind, solar, hydro—everything other than nuclear power. It also produces the most pollution, including particulates that damage human lungs, chemicals that contribute to acid rain, and coal ash that contains many toxic metals. It also emits the most carbon dioxide per unit of energy produced. Prior to Trump’s return to office, the US grid had been rapidly moving away from its use, including during his first term. Despite the long-standing Republican claims to support free markets, the second Trump administration has determined that the only way to keep coal viable is direct government intervention. Its initial attempts involved declaring an energy emergency and then using that to justify forcing coal plants slated for closure to continue operations. The emergency declaration relied on what appears to be a tenuous interpretation of the Federal Power Act, and the administration was already facing a lawsuit challenging these actions. Today’s executive order takes a different route to propping up coal: artificially inflating demand. “The Secretary of War, in coordination with the Secretary of Energy,” the order reads, “shall seek to procure power from the United States coal generation fleet by approving long-term Power Purchase Agreements, or entering into any similar contractual agreements, with coal-fired energy production facilities to serve Department of War installations or other mission-critical facilities.” The justification for this seems to come from an alternate reality with little relationship to the US grid. “It’s going to be less expensive and actually much more effective than what we have been using for many, many years,” Trump said at the event. “And again, with the environmental progress that’s been made on coal, it’s going to be just as clean.” None of that is true. The executive order instead seeks to highlight coal’s supposed ability to produce a constant power output, touting the “proven reliability of our coal-fired generation fleet in providing continuous, on-demand baseload power.” This seemingly ignores Texas’ recent experience, in which coal plants contributed significantly to the collapse of the state grid, having gone offline for a wide range of reasons. The Trump administration, however, has rarely let spurious justifications stand in the way of its preferred policy actions. The key action here is likely to be locking the military into long-term contracts that would persist beyond the end of Trump’s term in 2029.

Credit: Joe Raedle/Getty Images An entrance to Fort Bliss. Credit: Joe Raedle/Getty Images Text settings Story text Size Small Standard Large Width * Standard Wide Links Standard Orange * Subscribers only Learn more Minimize to nav On Tuesday night, the Federal Aviation Administration closed airspace up to 18,000 feet above the El Paso International Airport in Texas, saying the restrictions would be in place for 10 days. Then, less than 10 hours later, the federal agency reopened the airspace, allowing planes to land and take off at the busy airport. About an hour after lifting the restrictions, US Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy, whose responsibilities include overseeing the FAA, explained the unexpected closure by saying, “The FAA and DOW acted swiftly to address a cartel drone incursion.” (The Trump Administration refers to the Department of Defense as the Department of War, or DOW, although its legal name remains the former.) Not everyone agrees with Duffy’s account. Based upon reporting from The New York Times and other publications, the military has been developing high-energy lasers to bring down drones. The FAA and US military officials had been discussing tests of the new weapon from the nearby Fort Bliss Army base. However, the FAA had not resolved all of its concerns about airplane safety from the tests. Despite these apparently lingering concerns from the FAA, the military went ahead with a test earlier this week against what was thought to be a drone. The object was a party balloon. Cartel drones a serious threat That is not to make light of drone incursions. This is a real issue along the US border with Mexico, where cartels increasingly fly drones for surveillance. They are particularly useful for pinpointing the location of US Border Patrol agents to assist the cartel in smuggling non-citizens across the border into the United States. One of the many lessons from the war in Ukraine, which has rapidly pushed forward drone technology in contested environments, is that it is not practical to shoot down drones with conventional missiles. So it is understandable that the US military is looking at alternatives. This all culminated in some sort of snafu between the FAA and military officials regarding coordination with this week’s test. Whether it was genuine concern about air travelers, a show of force, a fit of pique, or something else, the FAA decided on Tuesday evening to take the extraordinary step of abruptly closing an airport that serves more than 3 million passengers a month. The proposed 10-day closure of the airport was remarkably long. Moreover, this action was taken without consulting local or state officials in Texas—who are understandably outraged—or reportedly even the White House. “I want to be very, very clear that this should’ve never happened,” El Paso Mayor Renard Johnson said during a news conference on Wednesday. “That failure to communicate is unacceptable.” Eric Berger Senior Space Editor Eric Berger Senior Space Editor Eric Berger is the senior space editor at Ars Technica, covering everything from astronomy to private space to NASA policy, and author of two books: Liftoff, about the rise of SpaceX; and Reentry, on the development of the Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon.

    "full_text": "NOT JUST ANOTHER ANNOYING CAPTCHA Once-hobbled Lumma Stealer is back with lures that are hard to resist ClickFix bait, combined with advanced Castleloader malware, is installing Lumma “at scale.” Dan Goodin – Feb 11, 2026 5:11 pm | 10 Credit: Getty Images Credit: Getty Images Text settings Story text Size Small Standard Large Width * Standard Wide Links Standard Orange * Subscribers only Learn more Minimize to nav Last May, law enforcement authorities around the world scored a key win when they hobbled the infrastructure of Lumma, an infostealer that infected nearly 395,000 Windows computers over just a two-month span leading up to the international operation. Researchers said Wednesday that Lumma is once again “back at scale” in hard-to-detect attacks that pilfer credentials and sensitive files. Lumma, also known as Lumma Stealer, first appeared in Russian-speaking cybercrime forums in 2022. Its cloud-based malware-as-a-service model provided a sprawling infrastructure of domains for hosting lure sites offering free cracked software, games, and pirated movies, as well as command-and-control channels and everything else a threat actor needed to run their infostealing enterprise. Within a year, Lumma was selling for as much as $2,500 for premium versions. By the spring of 2024, the FBI counted more than 21,000 listings on crime forums. Last year, Microsoft said Lumma had become the “go-to tool” for multiple crime groups, including Scattered Spider, one of the most prolific groups. Takedowns are hard The FBI and an international coalition of its counterparts took action early last year. In May, they said they seized 2,300 domains, command-and-control infrastructure, and crime marketplaces that had enabled the infostealer to thrive. Recently, however, the malware has made a comeback, allowing it to infect a significant number of machines again. “LummaStealer is back at scale, despite a major 2025 law-enforcement takedown that disrupted thousands of its command-and-control domains,” researchers from security firm Bitdefender wrote. “The operation has rapidly rebuilt its infrastructure and continues to spread worldwide.” As with Lumma before, the recent surge leans heavily on “ClickFix,” a form of social engineering lure that’s proving to be vexingly effective in causing end users to infect their own machines. Typically, these types of bait come in the form of fake CAPTCHAs that—rather requiring users to click a box or identify objects or letters in a jumbled image—instruct them to copy text and paste it into an interface, a process that takes just seconds. The text comes in the form of malicious commands provided by the fake CAPTCHA. The interface is the Windows terminal. Targets who comply then install loader malware, which in turn installs Lumma. A core part of the resurgence is the use of CastleLoader, a separate piece of malware that’s installed initially. It runs solely in memory, making it much harder to detect than malware that resides on a hard drive. Its code is heavily obfuscated, making it hard to spot its malice even when malware scanners can see it. CastleLoader also provides a flexible and full-featured command-and-control communication mechanism that users can customize to meet their specific needs. CastleLoader shares some of Lumma’s recently rebuilt infrastructure, an indication that the operators are working together or at least coordinating their activities. In other cases, Lumma relies on legitimate infrastructure—mostly from the content delivery networks Steam Workshop and Discord shared files—to be installed. The use of trusted platforms helps lower targets’ suspicions. In either case, once the loader is executed, it surreptitiously burrows into the infected machine and, after lowering defenses, installs its second payload: Lumma. It’s so easy to fall for ClickFix People have grown so accustomed to hard-to-solve CAPTCHAs that they think little when instructed to copy website-provided text, click the Win-R keys, and then choose paste. Once this simple action is performed, Lumma has free rein over a host of sensitive files stored on infected machines. Bitdefender said the data includes: Credentials saved in web browsers Cookies Personal documents (.docx, .pdf, etc.) Sensitive files containing financial information, secret keys (including cloud keys), 2FA backup codes, and server passwords, as well as cryptocurrency private keys and wallet data Personal data such as ID numbers, addresses, medical records, credit card numbers, and dates of birth Cryptocurrency wallets and browser extensions associated with popular services like MetaMask, Binance, Electrum, Ethereum, Exodus, Coinomi, Bitcoin Core, JAXX, and Steem Keychain. Data from remote access tools and password managers, specifically AnyDesk and KeePass.

As a result, victims often fail to recognize that they are manually executing arbitrary code on their own system.” While Lumma is targeting only Windows users, other malware campaigns have used the same technique to infect macOS machines since at least last June. More recent ClickFix attacks on macOS users have continued into this year. The best defense against ClickFix is to steer clear of sites offering free stuff. Windows and macOS provide a means to require a password before the command terminals can be opened. People with technical skills who administer machines on behalf of less experienced users may want to consider using this latter defense as well.

As the primary cover artist for Byte from 1975 to the late 1980s, Tinney became one of the first illustrators to give the abstract world of personal computing a coherent visual language, translating topics like artificial intelligence, networking, and programming into vivid, surrealist-influenced paintings that a generation of computer enthusiasts grew up with. Tinney went on to paint more than 80 covers for Byte, working almost entirely in airbrushed Designers Gouache, a medium he chose for its opaque, intense colors and smooth finish. He said the process of creating each cover typically took about a week of painting once a design was approved, following phone conversations with editors about each issue’s theme. He cited René Magritte and M.C. Escher as two of his favorite artists, and fans often noticed their influence in his work.

Credit: Family of Robert Tinney Born on November 22, 1947, in Penn Yan, New York, Tinney moved with his family to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, as a child. He studied illustration and graphic design at Louisiana Tech University, and after a tour of service during the Vietnam War, he began his career as a commercial artist in Houston. His connection to Byte came through a chance meeting with Carl Helmers, who would later found the magazine. In a 2006 interview I conducted with Tinney for my blog, Vintage Computing and Gaming, he recalled how the relationship began: “One day the phone rang in my Houston apartment and it was Carl wanting to know if I would be interested in painting covers for Byte.” His first cover appeared on the December 1975 issue, just three months after the magazine launched. Over time, his covers became so popular that he created limited-edition signed prints that he sold on his website for decades. “A friend suggested once that I should select the best covers and reproduce them as signed prints,” he said in 2006. “Byte was gracious enough to let me advertise the prints when they could fit in an ad (it did get bumped occasionally), and the prints were very popular in the Byte booth at the big computer shows, two or three of which my wife, Susan, and I attended per year. When an edition sold out, I then put the design on a T-shirt.” Byte stopped commissioning Tinney’s cover art around 1987, opting for product photographs as competition in the computer magazine market intensified. His final cover was for the magazine’s 15th Anniversary issue in September 1990. Computing’s Norman Rockwell What made Tinney’s work distinctive was the fact that he was not a technical person. He had no engineering background and said in the 2006 interview that he always felt “a little uneasy” around Byte’s editors because he didn’t speak their technical language. But he saw that as a strength. “I’ve always thought that my interpretation of computer issues with non-technical visual metaphors was what gave my illustrations their distinctive character,” he told me. “So maybe that was a case of making lemonade out of lemons.” That approach produced images that communicated instantly: a train running on a printed circuit board for an issue about computer engineering, a tiny computer wristwatch, or robots hatching from eggs. His 1981 Smalltalk cover featuring a colorful hot air balloon, according to his website, became a widely recognized symbol of object-oriented programming.

Credit: Robert Tinney / Byte Magazine After leaving Byte, Tinney created illustrations for electronics companies, including JDR Microdevices and Jameco Electronics, and created cover art for Borland’s Turbo Prolog and Turbo Basic software. He eventually transitioned to oil portraits and adopted Photoshop for commercial work. “Anything I can do with gouache and an airbrush, I can do about three times better with Photoshop,” he told me, “plus I don’t have to breathe the fumes!” Tinney is survived by his wife of 48 years, Susan, and their three children, nine grandchildren, and one great-grandchild. A celebration of his life will be held in May 2026. In his later years, Tinney grew philosophical about the future of illustration as a profession, noting that stock image databases had changed the economics of the field. But he remained upbeat about the value of artistic talent, comparing it in that 2006 interview to the skill of public speaking: “It’s a nice talent to have, but it isn’t easy to find someone who’ll pay you just to do it. You need to combine that basic talent with another skill to really have a marketable service.” Benj Edwards Senior AI Reporter Benj Edwards Senior AI Reporter Benj Edwards is Ars Technica's Senior AI Reporter and founder of the site's dedicated AI beat in 2022.

The Steam Deck has gone in and out of stock in the past, but as Kotaku notes, the timing does raise the question whether Valve's RAM issues could also be impacting its Linux handheld. \nThe 256GB Steam Deck LCD, and both the 512GB and 1TB models of the Steam Deck OLED, are completely sold out on Steam. Valve announced that it was discontinuing the LCD versions of its handheld and selling through its remaining inventory in December 2025, so the fact that the 256GB Steam Deck model is currently sold out isn't surprising. That both OLED versions are also unavailable at the same time, though, is a bit more unusual.\nEngadget has contacted Valve for more information about the availability of the Steam Deck. We'll update this article if we hear back.\nWhen Valve announced the Steam Machine, Steam Controller and Steam Frame, the company notably left pricing and availability off the table, presumably because tariffs and access to RAM were leaving those details in flux. The company's announcement last week that the memory and storage shortage had pushed back its plans and would likely impact prices more or less confirmed that. At no point did Valve mention that the Steam Deck would be similarly affected, but maybe it should have.\nThe rising cost of RAM has already forced other PC makers to adjust the pricing of their computers. Framework announced in January that it was raising the price of its Framework Desktop by as much as $460. Some analysts assume that the memory shortage driven by the AI industry could lead to higher prices and even an economic downturn in the wider PC industry. Ideally, the Steam Deck being out of stock is a temporary issue rather than a sign that Valve is doing something drastic. If things continue as they are, however, changes to the Steam Deck likely won't be off the table.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/the-great-ramaggedon-of-2026-might-have-just-claimed-the-steam-deck-211958306.html?src=rss",

There was a grass fire where Archimedes engines undergo testing. Could they please send personnel over? According to the fire station’s November 30 dispatcher log, the employee said, “The fire started during a test when an anomaly caused an electrical box to catch fire.” Satellite imagery from before and after the anomaly appears to show that the roof had been blown off the left test cell, one of two at the test stand at the historic NASA facility in southern Mississippi. One person with knowledge of the anomaly said, “The characterization of this as an electrical fire doesn’t reflect what actually occurred. This was a catastrophic engine explosion that resulted in significant infrastructure damage.” According to two sources, this is one of at least two Archimedes engine tests that have failed in the past three months. The engine test anomalies come at a critical time for Rocket Lab, as it is attempting to finalize development of a flight version of the Archimedes engine, which burns liquid oxygen and methane and has a sea-level thrust of 165,000 pounds. Nine of these engines will power the company’s much-anticipated Neutron rocket, which is aiming for a debut launch later this year. Making mountains out of molehills? In response to a query from Ars about the engine test anomalies, Rocket Lab Chief Executive Officer Pete Beck downplayed concerns. “Eric, you are trying to make a story out of nothing,” Beck said. “We test to the limits, that’s part of developing a successful rocket. We often put the engine into very off nominal states to find the limits and sometimes they let go, this is normal and how you ensure rockets don’t fail in flight.” Rocket companies do test engines to the point of failure. These tests often occur out of public view on private or government property. However, when NASASpaceflight installed cameras outside SpaceX’s McGregor engine test facilities in Texas, it became clear that rocket engines, such as the company’s new Raptor engine, are pushed to failure not infrequently. What is not clear is how often this failure is intentional. Beck said Rocket Lab is presently pushing the Archimedes engine to find its failure modes and performance in edge cases. “Right now we are in the part of the program where we are doing very nasty things to the engine like backing right off the suction pressure, inducing cavitation and exploring outside the run box,” he said. “These things can often lead to engines letting go. We have two test cells so we can do these types of tests and not interrupt our test cadence or production flow, hence there is zero impact to schedule, in fact 48 hours later we were running engines again.” Beck has previously said that it is Rocket Lab’s goal to identify failures during component-level testing so that when Neutron launches, it has a high chance of reaching orbit on its first go.

Guano dramatically boosted the production of maize, and the surplus helped fuel the Chincha Kingdom’s economy.

Scientists have long puzzled over the foundation for that prosperity, and it seems one critical factor was bird poop, according to a new paper published in the journal PLoS ONE. “Seabird guano may seem trivial, yet our study suggests this potent resource could have significantly contributed to sociopolitical and economic change in the Peruvian Andes,” said co-author Jacob Bongers, a digital archaeologist at the University of Sydney. “Guano dramatically boosted the production of maize (corn), and this agricultural surplus crucially helped fuel the Chincha Kingdom’s economy, driving their trade, wealth, population growth and regional influence, and shaped their strategic alliance with the Inca Empire. In ancient Andean cultures, fertiliser was power.” Last November, Bongers co-authored a paper detailing evidence supporting the hypothesis that the mysterious “Band of Holes” on Mount Sierpe in the Andes might have been an ancient marketplace. Aerial photographs from the 1930s first revealed that long row of around 5,200 precisely aligned holes, seemingly organized into blocked sections, most likely constructed by the Chincha Kingdom. Scholars had suggested various hypotheses for what the site’s purpose may have been: defense, storage, or accounting, perhaps, or maybe to collect water and capture fog for local gardens. But nobody had any strong evidence for those suggestions. Bongers conducted microbotanical sediment analysis of samples taken from the site and combined that data with new high-resolution aerial drone imagery. The former found traces of ancient maize pollens and reeds used in basket-weaving, indicating that the locals deposited plants transported in woven baskets or bundles into those holes. Bongers interpreted this as evidence of a pre-Inca marketplace where people exchanged local goods for the wares of mobile traders. A nutrient-rich natural fertilizer Now Bongers has turned his attention to analyzing the biochemical signatures of 35 maize samples excavated from buried tombs in the region. He and his co-authors found significantly higher levels of nitrogen in the maize than in the natural soil conditions, suggesting the Chincha used guano as a natural fertilizer. The guano from such birds as the guanay cormorant, the Peruvian pelican, and the Peruvian booby contains all the essential growing nutrients: nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. All three species are abundant on the Chincha Islands, all within 25 kilometers of the kingdom. “We’re all looking for the birds who did this.” Diego H. and Claude Kolwelter, iNaturalist.org “We’re all looking for the birds who did this.” Diego H. and Claude Kolwelter, iNaturalist.org Maize cobs from a tomb in the middle Chincha Valley in Peru.

Bongers et al., 2026, PLOS One, CC-BY 4.0 19th century poster advertising the sale of Pacific seabird guano in the US. Public domain Those results were further bolstered by historical written sources describing how seabird guano was collected and its importance for trade and production of food. For instance, during colonial eras, groups would sail to nearby islands on rafts to collect bird droppings to use as crop fertilizer. The Lunahuana people in the Canete Valley just outside of Chincha were known to use bird guano in their fields, and the Inca valued the stuff so highly that it restricted access to the islands during breeding season and forbade the killing of the guano-producing birds on penalty of death. The 19th-century Swiss naturalist Johann Jakob von Tschudi also reported observing the guano being used as fertilizer, with a fist-sized amount added to each plant before submerging entire fields in water. It was even imported to the US. The authors also pointed out that much of the iconography from Chincha and nearby valleys featured seabirds: textiles, ceramics, balance-beam scales, spindles, decorated gourds, adobe friezes and wall paintings, ceremonial wooden paddles, and gold and silver metalworks. “The true power of the Chincha wasn’t just access to a resource; it was their mastery of a complex ecological system,” said co-author Jo Osborn of Texas A&M University. “They possessed the traditional knowledge to see the connection between marine and terrestrial life, and they turned that knowledge into the agricultural surplus that built their kingdom. Their art celebrates this connection, showing us that their power was rooted in ecological wisdom, not just gold or silver.” PLoS ONE, 2026. DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0341263 (About DOIs).

Benj Edwards – Feb 11, 2026 3:44 pm | 60 Credit: Aurich Lawson | Getty Images Credit: Aurich Lawson | Getty Images Text settings Story text Size Small Standard Large Width * Standard Wide Links Standard Orange * Subscribers only Learn more Minimize to nav On Wednesday, former OpenAI researcher Zoë Hitzig published a guest essay in The New York Times announcing that she resigned from the company on Monday, the same day OpenAI began testing advertisements inside ChatGPT. Hitzig, an economist and published poet who holds a junior fellowship at the Harvard Society of Fellows, spent two years at OpenAI helping shape how its AI models were built and priced. She wrote that OpenAI’s advertising strategy risks repeating the same mistakes that Facebook made a decade ago. “I once believed I could help the people building A.I. get ahead of the problems it would create,” Hitzig wrote. “This week confirmed my slow realization that OpenAI seems to have stopped asking the questions I’d joined to help answer.” Hitzig did not call advertising itself immoral. Instead, she argued that the nature of the data at stake makes ChatGPT ads especially risky. Users have shared medical fears, relationship problems, and religious beliefs with the chatbot, she wrote, often “because people believed they were talking to something that had no ulterior agenda.” She called this accumulated record of personal disclosures “an archive of human candor that has no precedent.” She also drew a direct parallel to Facebook’s early history, noting that the social media company once promised users control over their data and the ability to vote on policy changes. Those pledges eroded over time, Hitzig wrote, and the Federal Trade Commission found that privacy changes Facebook marketed as giving users more control actually did the opposite. She warned that a similar trajectory could play out with ChatGPT: “I believe the first iteration of ads will probably follow those principles. But I’m worried subsequent iterations won’t, because the company is building an economic engine that creates strong incentives to override its own rules.” Ads arrive after a week of AI industry sparring Hitzig’s resignation adds another voice to a growing debate over advertising in AI chatbots. OpenAI announced in January that it would begin testing ads in the US for users on its free and $8-per-month “Go” subscription tiers, while paid Plus, Pro, Business, Enterprise, and Education subscribers would not see ads. The company said ads would appear at the bottom of ChatGPT responses, be clearly labeled, and would not influence the chatbot’s answers. The rollout on Sunday followed a week of public jabs between OpenAI and its rival, Anthropic. Anthropic declared Claude would remain ad-free, then ran Super Bowl ads with the tagline “Ads are coming to AI. But not to Claude,” which depicted AI chatbots awkwardly inserting product placements into personal conversations. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman called the ads “funny” but “clearly dishonest,” writing on X that OpenAI “would obviously never run ads in the way Anthropic depicts them.” He framed the ad-supported model as a way to bring AI to users who cannot afford subscriptions, writing that “Anthropic serves an expensive product to rich people.” Anthropic responded as part of an advertising campaign of its own that including ads in conversations with its Claude chatbot “would be incompatible with what we want Claude to be: a genuinely helpful assistant for work and for deep thinking.” The company said more than 80 percent of its revenue comes from enterprise customers. What Hitzig saw from the inside Regardless of the debate over whether AI chatbots should carry ads, OpenAI’s support documentation reveals that ad personalization is enabled by default for users in the test. If left on, ads will be selected using information from current and past chat threads, as well as past ad interactions. Advertisers do not receive users’ chats or personal details, OpenAI says, and ads will not appear near conversations about health, mental health, or politics. In her essay, Hitzig pointed to what she called an existing tension in OpenAI’s principles. She noted that while the company states it does not optimize for user activity solely to generate advertising revenue, reporting has suggested that OpenAI already optimizes for daily active users, “likely by encouraging the model to be more flattering and sycophantic.” She warned that this optimization can make users feel more dependent on AI models for support, pointing to psychiatrists who have documented instances of “chatbot psychosis” and allegations that ChatGPT reinforced suicidal ideation. OpenAI currently faces multiple wrongful death lawsuits, including one alleging ChatGPT helped a teenager plan his suicide and another alleging it validated a man’s paranoid delusions about his mother before a murder-suicide. Rather than framing the debate as ads versus no ads, Hitzig proposed several structural alternatives. These included cross-subsidies modeled on the FCC’s universal service fund (in which businesses that pay for high-value AI labor would subsidize free access for others), independent oversight boards with binding authority over how conversational data is used in ad targeting, and data trusts or cooperatives in which users retain control of their information. She pointed to the Swiss cooperative MIDATA and Germany’s co-determination laws as partial precedents. Hitzig closed her essay with what she described as the two outcomes she fears most: “a technology that manipulates the people who use it at no cost, and one that exclusively benefits the few who can afford to use it.” A changing of the AI seasons Hitzig was not the only prominent AI researcher to publicly resign this week. On Sunday, Mrinank Sharma, who led Anthropic’s Safeguards Research Team and co-authored a widely cited 2023 study on AI sycophancy, announced his departure in a letter warning that “the world is in peril.” He wrote that he had “repeatedly seen how hard it is to truly let our values govern our actions” inside the organization and said he plans to pursue a poetry degree (Hitzig, coincidentally, is also a published poet). On Monday, xAI co-founder Yuhuai “Tony” Wu also resigned, followed the next day by fellow co-founder Jimmy Ba. They were part of a larger wave: at least nine xAI employees, including the two co-founders, publicly announced their departures over the past week, according to TechCrunch. Six of the company’s 12 original co-founders have now left. The departures follow Elon Musk’s decision to merge xAI with SpaceX in an all-stock deal ahead of a planned IPO, a transaction that converted xAI equity into shares of a company valued at $1.25 trillion, though it is unclear whether the timing of the departures is related to vesting schedules. The three sets of departures across OpenAI, Anthropic, and xAI appear unrelated in their specifics, but they arrive during a period of rapid commercialization across the AI industry that has tested the patience of researchers at multiple companies, and they fit a broader pattern of turnover and burnout that has become common at major AI labs.

Andrew Cunningham – Feb 11, 2026 3:28 pm | 37 A PC running Windows 11. Credit: Microsoft A PC running Windows 11. Credit: Microsoft Text settings Story text Size Small Standard Large Width * Standard Wide Links Standard Orange * Subscribers only Learn more Minimize to nav Since its release in the fall of 2021, Microsoft’s Windows 11 has received an “annual feature update” in the second half of every year. These feature updates sometimes include new Windows features and other changes that are too large to roll out in a typical monthly Windows Update, and users need to upgrade to new ones to keep getting security patches and other features. The currently supported versions are Windows 11 24H2 and 25H2, released in the fall of 2024 and 2025, respectively. This week, Microsoft disrupted that update cadence by announcing more information on Windows 11 26H1, which is best described not as an update to Windows 11 but as another version of the operating system entirely. That’s because 26H1 is a “scoped” release intended exclusively for new PCs, starting with those based on Qualcomm’s recently announced Snapdragon X2 Elite chips. Microsoft’s support page explains why this release is strange: It won’t be released broadly to other Windows 11 PCs, which should continue to use either 24H2 or 25H2. PCs running 24H2 or 25H2 will never be offered an update to version 26H1, though testers in the Windows Insider Program’s early access Canary channel are able to install it to other PCs if they want. (Build numbers for Windows 11 26H1 start with 28000, compared to 26100 for 24H2 and 26200 for 25H2.) Users of PCs that ship with Windows 11 26H1 also won’t be able to upgrade to the next major release of Windows, which will presumably be released this fall as Windows 11 26H2. An update that will get the entire Windows ecosystem back on the same version number will be released, but the company isn’t saying when; assume it will happen before March 2028, which is the cutoff for security updates for the Home and Pro editions of Windows 11 26H1. For most users, the behind-the-scenes distinction between these different Windows versions should be mostly invisible. Microsoft says that 26H1 “will continue receiving monthly updates for security, quality, and new features, the same as devices running Windows 11, versions 24H2 and 25H2.” And the company rolls so many new Windows features out through the Microsoft Store or through standard monthly updates that the underlying version of Windows matters less than it used to. But for app developers, IT shops, and anyone else who needs to test things against multiple Windows versions at once, it does create an odd period of overlap where they’ll need to account for one version of Windows that runs just on these brand-new PCs, and one version of Windows that covers everybody else. Special treatment for Arm PCs Releasing a new version of Windows that just covers new Arm PCs is another signal of Microsoft’s commitment to Arm processors and the Arm version of Windows, after decades of near-exclusive focus on the x86 version of the OS that ran on Intel and AMD’s chips. Microsoft offered multiple versions of both Windows 10 and Windows 11 in both x86 and Arm editions, but the 24H2 update was a major milestone for Arm PCs. It came with big under-the-hood changes to Windows’ compiler, kernel, and scheduler, and an optimized x86-to-Arm translation layer called Prism that enhanced the compatibility and performance of apps that hadn’t been built to run on Arm processors. The 24H2 update also coincided with the release of the first-generation Qualcomm Snapdragon X-series processors, high-performance Arm chips developed by some of the same people behind Apple’s M-series chips for Macs. Many third-party developers have also finally released Arm-native versions of their Windows apps, which are faster and more responsive than translated x86 apps. Microsoft’s confidence in the Arm version of Windows was so great that the new Surface PCs released in mid-2024 used Qualcomm’s processors exclusively, relegating Intel chips to offshoot versions for businesses with strict compatibility requirements. For years previously, Microsoft had treated the Intel- and AMD-based Surfaces as the “main” ones and the Arm-based Surface Pro X as the offshoot. Since the 24H2 update, development on the Arm and the traditional x86 versions of Windows has happened at slightly different rates. Some features, particularly things like Recall and Click To Do that were only rolling out to Copilot+ PCs with fast built-in neural processing units (NPUs), have been available for the Arm versions of Windows for a few weeks or months before they hit the x86 versions. Windows 11 24H2 itself was also shipping on Arm PCs in stores several months before Microsoft began rolling the update out to the wider PC ecosystem. We’ve asked Microsoft to elaborate on what the Windows 11 26H1 update includes and whether it contains any changes that will benefit the wider PC ecosystem somewhere down the line. We’ll update the article if we receive a response.

Ryan Whitwam – Feb 11, 2026 3:15 pm | 90 Google's Nest doorbells only save a few hours of video without a subscription. Credit: Ryan Whitwam Google's Nest doorbells only save a few hours of video without a subscription. Credit: Ryan Whitwam Text settings Story text Size Small Standard Large Width * Standard Wide Links Standard Orange * Subscribers only Learn more Minimize to nav Like most cloud-enabled home security cameras, Google’s Nest products don’t provide long-term storage unless you pay a monthly fee. That video may not vanish into the digital aether right on time, though. Investigators involved with the high-profile abduction of Nancy Guthrie have released video from Guthrie’s Nest doorbell camera—video that was believed to have been deleted because Guthrie wasn’t paying for the service. Google’s cameras connect to the recently upgraded Home Premium subscription service. For $10 per month, you get 30 days of stored events, and $20 gets you 60 days of events with 10 days of the full video. If you don’t pay anything, Google only saves three hours of event history. After that, the videos are deleted, at least as far as the user is concerned. Newer Nest cameras have limited local storage that can cache clips for a few hours in case connectivity drops out, but there is no option for true local storage. Guthrie’s camera was reportedly destroyed by the perpetrators. Suspect in abduction approaches doorbell camera. Expired videos are no longer available to the user, and Google won’t restore them even if you later upgrade to a premium account. However, that doesn’t mean the data is truly gone. Nancy Guthrie was abducted from her home in the early hours of February 1, and at first, investigators said there was no video of the crime because the doorbell camera was not on a paid account. Yet, video showing a masked individual fiddling with the camera was published on February 10. The first video shows the person approaching the door and noticing the doorbell camera. They place their hand over the lens and appear to pull on the mounting bracket. Nest doorbell cameras have a small security screw that makes it difficult to remove them without causing damage. In the second video, the individual seems to try to drape a plant over the camera to block its view. Both videos are short, which is what you’d expect from an “event” as identified by the Google Home system. Suspect attempts to cover the camera with a plant. In statements made by investigators, the video was apparently “recovered from residual data located in backend systems.” It’s unclear how long such data is retained or how easy it is for Google to access it. Some reports claim that it took several days for Google to recover the data. In large-scale enterprise storage solutions, “deleted” for the user doesn’t always mean that the data is gone. Data that is no longer needed is often compressed and overwritten only as needed. In the meantime, it may be possible to recover the data. That’s something a company like Google could decide to do on its own, or it could be compelled to perform the recovery by a court order. In the Guthrie case, it sounds like Google was voluntarily cooperating with the investigation, which makes sense. Publishing video of the alleged perpetrator could be a major breakthrough as investigators seek help from the public. It’s not your cloud There is a temptation to ascribe some malicious intent to Google’s video storage setup. After all, this video expired after three hours, but here it is nine days later. That feels a bit suspicious on the surface, particularly for a company that is so focused on training AI models that feed on video. We have previously asked Google to explain how it uses Nest to train AI models, and the company claims it does not incorporate user videos into training data, but the way you interact with the service and with your videos is fair game. “We may use your inputs, including prompts and feedback, usage, and outputs from interactions with AI features to further research, tune, and train Google’s generative models, machine learning technologies, and related products and services,” Google said. If we take Google at its word, it has no incentive to keep “deleted” user videos around. If no one is paying for the storage, keeping it only costs the company money. Still, this is something to keep in mind if you’re using a Google camera. Even if you aren’t paying for storage, every event recorded by the camera is going to Google’s servers, and it’s probably recoverable long past the deletion timeline stipulated in the company’s policy. If this concerns you, there are still traditional “DVR” security cameras, which record footage to dedicated local storage. Many NAS boxes also have support for storing and managing video from select security cameras. If you’re sending video to the cloud, you can’t expect it to be totally gone even if you no longer have access to it. When Google announced its big Gemini-powered Home revamp late last year, we asked whether it retained any user video beyond the limits specified in its plans. Representatives did not address the substance of the question at the time. We’ve again asked Google to clarify its storage policy for user videos, as well as the circumstances in which it might recover “deleted” videos. The company has not responded as of this posting.

Credit: Getty Images | Kevin Dietsch Text settings Story text Size Small Standard Large Width * Standard Wide Links Standard Orange * Subscribers only Learn more Minimize to nav The National Labor Relations Board abandoned a Biden-era complaint against SpaceX after a finding that the agency does not have jurisdiction over Elon Musk’s space company. The US labor board said SpaceX should instead be regulated under the Railway Labor Act, which governs labor relations at railroad and airline companies. The Railway Labor Act is enforced by a separate agency, the National Mediation Board, and has different rules than the National Labor Relations Act enforced by the NLRB. For example, the Railway Labor Act has an extensive dispute-resolution process that makes it difficult for railroad and airline employees to strike. Employers regulated under the Railway Labor Act are exempt from the National Labor Relations Act. In January 2024, an NLRB regional director alleged in a complaint that SpaceX illegally fired eight employees who, in an open letter, criticized CEO Musk as a “frequent source of embarrassment.” The complaint sought reinstatement of the employees, back pay, and letters of apology to the fired employees. SpaceX responded by suing the NLRB, claiming the labor agency’s structure is unconstitutional. But a different issue SpaceX raised later—that it is a common carrier, like a rail company or airline—is what compelled the NLRB to drop its case. US regulators ultimately decided that SpaceX should be treated as a “common carrier by air” and “a carrier by air transporting mail” for the government. SpaceX deemed a common carrier In a February 6 letter to attorneys who represent the fired employees, NLRB Regional Director Danielle Pierce said the agency would defer to a National Mediation Board opinion that SpaceX is a common carrier: In the course of the investigation and litigation of this case, a question was presented as to whether the Employer’s operations fall within the jurisdiction of the Railway Labor Act (“RLA”) rather than the [National Labor Relations] Act. As a result, consistent with Board law, the matter was referred to the National Mediation Board (“NMB”) on May 21, 2025 for an opinion as to whether the Employer is covered by the RLA. On January 14, 2026, the NMB issued its decision finding that the Employer is subject to the RLA as a common carrier by air engaged in interstate or foreign commerce as well as a carrier by air transporting mail for or under contract with the United States Government. Accordingly, the National Labor Relations Board lacks jurisdiction over the Employer and, therefore, I am dismissing your charge. The letter was provided to Ars today by Anne Shaver, an attorney for the fired SpaceX employees. “The Railway Labor Act does not apply to space travel,” Shaver told Ars. “It is alarming that the NMB would take the initiative to radically expand the RLA’s jurisdiction to space travel absent direction from Congress, and that the NLRB would simply defer. We find the decision to be contrary to law and public policy.” We contacted the NLRB today and will update this article if it provides a response. The NLRB decision was previously reported by Bloomberg and The New York Times. “Jennifer Abruzzo, NLRB general counsel under former President Joe Biden, had rejected SpaceX’s claim that allegations against the company should be handled by the NMB,” Bloomberg wrote. “After President Donald Trump fired her in January last year, SpaceX asked the labor board to reconsider the issue.” NLRB looked for way to settle In April 2025, SpaceX and the NLRB told a federal appeals court in a joint filing that the NLRB would ask the NMB to decide whether it had jurisdiction over SpaceX. The decision to seek the NMB’s opinion was made “in the interests of potentially settling the legal disputes currently pending between the NLRB and SpaceX on terms mutually agreeable to both parties,” the joint filing said. Shaver provided a July 2025 filing that the employees’ attorneys made with the NMB. The filing said that despite SpaceX claiming to hold itself out to the public as a common carrier through its website and certain marketing materials, the firm doesn’t actually carry passengers without “a negotiated, bespoke contract.” “SpaceX’s descriptions of its transport activities are highly misleading,” the filing said. “First, regarding human spaceflight, other than sending astronauts to the ISS on behalf of the US and foreign governments, it has only ever agreed to contract with two very wealthy, famous entrepreneurs. The Inspiration4 and Polaris Dawn missions were both for Jared Isaacman, CEO of Shift4 and President Trump’s former pick to lead NASA prior to his public falling out with SpaceX CEO Elon Musk. Fram2 was for Chun Wang, a cryptocurrency investor who reportedly paid $55 million per seat. A total of two private customers for human spaceflight does not a common carrier make.” The letter said that SpaceX redacted pricing information from marketing materials it submitted as exhibits. “If these were actually marketing materials provided to the public, there would be no need to redact pricing information,” the filing said. “SpaceX’s redactions underscore that it provides such materials at its discretion to select recipients, not to the public at large—far from the conduct of a true common carrier.” The ex-employees’ attorneys further argued that SpaceX is not engaged in interstate or foreign commerce as defined by the Railway Labor Act. “SpaceX’s transport activities are not between one state or territory and another, nor between a state or territory and a foreign nation, nor between points in the same state but through another state. Rather, they originate in Florida, Texas, or California, and go to outer space,” the filing said. Spaceflight company and… mail carrier? The filing also disputed SpaceX’s argument that it is a “carrier by air transporting mail for or under contract with the United States Government.” Evidence presented by SpaceX shows only that it carried SpaceX employee letters to the crew of the International Space Station and “crew supplies provided for by the US government in its contracts with SpaceX to haul cargo to the ISS,” the filing said. “They do not show that the government has contracted with SpaceX as a ‘mail carrier.’” SpaceX’s argument “is rife with speculation regarding its plans for the future,” the ex-employees’ attorneys told the NMB. “One can only surmise that the reason for its constant reference to its future intent to develop its role as a ‘common carrier’ is the lack of current standing in that capacity.” The filing said Congress would have to add space travel to the Railway Labor Act’s jurisdiction in order for SpaceX to be considered a common carrier. When asked about plans for appeal, Shaver noted that they have a pending case in US District Court for the Central District of California: Holland-Thielen et al v. SpaceX and Elon Musk. “The status of that case is that we defeated SpaceX’s motion to compel arbitration at the district court level, and that is now on appeal to the 9th circuit,” she said. SpaceX’s lawsuit against the NLRB is still ongoing at the US Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, but the case was put on hold while the sides waited for the NMB and NLRB to decide which agency has jurisdiction over SpaceX.

    "summary": "This is going to be one of the shortest articles in my series on how to cancel your subscriptions to the best VPNs. Unlike most providers, Mullvad VPN does not automatically renew an expired subscription unless you tell it to. Thanks to its unique pricing approach, cancelling Mullvad is the default option.\nWhen you sign up for Mullvad, you pay for as many months upfront as you want at the constant rate of 5 Euro per month (varying with exchange rates). Each month, Mullvad takes 5 Euro out of your account until there's nothing left. If you're no longer satisfied with Mullvad, all you have to do is stop putting money in.\nThe Mullvad account dashboard.\nSam Chapman for Engadget\n\nIf you happen to have originally signed up for Mullvad earlier than the middle of 2022, you may have an auto-renewal account grandfathered in. Mid-2022 is when Mullvad stopped auto-renewing subscriptions and got rid of PayPal integration altogether, but people who had signed up before then had the option to leave auto-renewal on.\nIf you're in this group, cancelling is simple. Just sign into your account page, click on the word Subscriptions, then click Unsubscribe.\nHow to cancel Mullvad if you subscribed through an app store\nThere's one more exception to the usual method of cancelling Mullvad. If you got your subscription through an app store instead of Mullvad's website or app, the app store is the one processing your money. You'll need to cancel through them instead.\nOn an iPhone or iPad, open the Settings app, whose icon shows gray gears. Tap your name at the top of the screen to reach your Apple ID page, then tab Subscriptions. Scroll down until you find your Mullvad subscription, tap it, then hit Cancel Subscription.\nOn an Android phone, open the Google Play Store, whose icon is a triangle in the Google colors. At the top-right, tap the circle with the first letter of your username in it. Hit Payments & Subscriptions, scroll down to find Mullvad, then tap it and hit Cancel Subscription.\nHow to delete your Mullvad account\nYou can go the extra mile and delete your account if you're sure you'll never want to use Mullvad again. Send an email to support@mullvadvpn.net, provide your account number and request that the account be terminated. You'll get a reply confirming deletion.\nHow to get a refund from Mullvad\nMullvad offers refunds on any purchase within 14 days. To start a refund request, send an email to support@mullvadvpn.net, including your Mullvad account number and your payment token. If you aren't sure what your payment token is, find the charge for Mullvad on your bank statement and look for something in the format VPN*(10-digit number).\nPayments made in cash can't be refunded, apparently because that's considered a form of money laundering in Sweden. If you got Mullvad through a voucher, request your refund through the store the voucher came from.\nBest Mullvad alternatives\nMullvad is one of the best VPNs, especially in terms of privacy. However, I've found it to be a bit slow at times, with a somewhat limited server network. Luckily, Proton VPN is almost as private as Mullvad — the only thing it's missing is the ability to sign up without an email. It's also got a larger server network and better overall download speeds.\nWindscribe is another privacy-optimized VPN with a better record than Mullvad in my unblocking tests. Surfshark is the fastest VPN of them all, while ExpressVPN is ideal for beginners. If you liked Mullvad's cheap pricing, CyberGhost is a highly affordable alternative.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/how-to-cancel-mullvad-vpn-200000516.html?src=rss",

Credit: Apple Text settings Story text Size Small Standard Large Width * Standard Wide Links Standard Orange * Subscribers only Learn more Minimize to nav Apple has just released the latest major updates for iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS 26 Tahoe, and all the other operating systems it released back in September of 2025. The 26.3 updates for these operating systems are fairly mild, focusing mostly on bug fixes and security patches, but Apple is adding a handful of iPhone features designed to make it easier to use third-party devices in Apple’s ecosystem. The first is a “transfer to Android” feature that will facilitate switching away from Apple’s phones into the Android ecosystem. Apple offers to transfer “photos, messages, notes, apps, and more,” as well as the user’s phone number, but won’t transfer things like Bluetooth pairing information or sensitive data from the Health app. Whether third-party apps can have their data transferred is likely tied to the AppMigrationKit developer framework that Apple added in iOS 26.1. Apps using this framework can import and export data to and from other devices and also access and download content the app has stored in the cloud. Apple notes that AppMigrationKit only functions for transfers from an Apple device to a non-Apple device; Apple already has several systems in place for preserving and transferring data and settings when upgrading from one iPhone to another. The transfer system will rely on the target Android phone also supporting the feature; on Google’s end, the Data Transfer API was only added in the recent “QPR2” update to Android 16, released in early December. Android phone makers are considerably better about updates than they used to be, but it will still take time for a critical mass of even the newest non-Pixel Android devices to get this update. Apple released a “Move to iOS” Android app back in 2015 to make switching to the iPhone easier and away from Android. Doubtlessly, that’s still the direction Apple hopes most switches will go. But as with Android’s gradually improving support for AirDrop, better interoperability is a pretty straightforward win for users. Other additions, and other OSes Another iOS 26.3 update is also aimed at interoperability, though it may only apply to iPhones covered by European Union regulations. A feature called “notification forwarding” will send your iPhone’s notifications to third-party accessories, including Google’s Android-based Wear OS smartwatches. Once the setting is enabled, users will be able to decide which apps can forward notifications to the third-party device, similar to how Apple Watch notifications work. In current betas, Apple allows notifications to be forwarded to only one device at a time, and forwarding notifications to a third-party device means you can’t send them to an Apple Watch. Finally, both iOS 26.3 and iPadOS 26.3 are introducing a feature for some newer devices with Apple’s in-house C1 and C1X modems: a “limit precise location” toggle that Apple says “enhances your location privacy by reducing the precision of location data available to cellular networks.” This feature is currently only available on a handful of devices and even fewer carriers: In the US, Boost Mobile is the only one. Only the iPhone Air, iPhone 16e, or the M5 iPad Pro will offer the toggle; devices like the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, and older phones with Qualcomm or Intel modems won’t support the feature. Apple has also updated all of its other major operating systems today. But macOS 26.3, iPadOS 26.3, watchOS 26.3, tvOS 26.3, visionOS 26.3 and version 26.3 of the HomePod software are all quieter updates of the bug-fixes-and-performance-improvements variety. Beta testers have found early evidence of support for the M5 Max and M5 Ultra chips, pointing to pending refreshes for some higher-end Macs, but that doesn’t tell us much we didn’t already know. The 26.3 updates are mostly sleepy, but the 26.4 releases may be a bigger deal. These are said to be the first to include Apple’s “more intelligent Siri,” a feature initially promised as part of the first wave of Apple Intelligence updates in iOS 18 but delayed after it failed to meet Apple’s quality standards. Apple and Google jointly announced in January that the new Siri would be powered by Google’s Gemini language models rather than OpenAI’s ChatGPT or other competing models. As with other Apple Intelligence features, we’d expect the new Siri to be available to testers via Apple’s developer and public beta programs before being released to all devices.

The demonstration “marks a significant breakthrough in the development of [China’s] manned lunar exploration program,” the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA) said in a statement. China and the United States are racing to accomplish the next human landing on the Moon in a competition for national prestige and lunar resources. The Long March 10 rocket and Mengzhou spacecraft, both tested Tuesday, are core elements of China’s lunar architecture. The launch of a subscale version of the Long March 10 rocket, still in development, provided engineers with an opportunity to verify the performance of an important part of the new Mengzhou capsule’s safety system. The test began with liftoff of the Long March 10 booster from a new launch pad at Wenchang Space Launch Site on Hainan Island, China’s southernmost province, at 10 pm EST Tuesday (03:00 UTC or 11 am Beijing time Wednesday). A test version of the Mengzhou spacecraft, flying without anyone onboard, climbed into the stratosphere on top of the Long March booster before activating its launch abort motors a little more than a minute into the flight as the rocket reached the moment of maximum aerodynamic pressure, known as Max-Q. The abort motors pulled the capsule away from the booster, simulating an in-flight escape that might be necessary to whisk crews away from a failing rocket. The Mengzhou spacecraft later deployed parachutes and splashed down offshore from Hainan Island. NASA and SpaceX performed similar in-flight abort tests before flying astronauts on the Orion and Dragon spacecraft. The test boosters on the Orion and Dragon abort tests were expended, but the Long March 10 rocket wasn’t finished after the Mengzhou abort command. Remarkably, the booster continued its ascent without the crew capsule, soaring into space on the power of its kerosene-fueled YF-100 engines before reentering the atmosphere, reigniting its engines, and nailing a propulsive landing in the South China Sea, right next to a recovery barge waiting to bring it back to shore. “The rocket’s first stage and the spacecraft’s return capsule were safely splashed down in the designated sea area according to procedures,” CMSA said. A recap video released by Chinese state television shows highlights from the test flight. One test, two goals In a matter of minutes, Chinese engineers moved closer to human-rating the Mengzhou crew capsule and achieved the country’s most successful test of a reusable rocket. “The test successfully verified the functional performance of the rocket’s first stage ascent and recovery phases, as well as the maximum dynamic pressure escape and recovery of the spacecraft,” CMSA said. “It also verified the compatibility of relevant interfaces across various engineering systems, accumulating valuable flight data and engineering experience for subsequent manned lunar exploration missions.” The low-altitude demonstration of the Mengzhou launch abort system follows a ground-level abort test last year that verified the spacecraft’s ability to escape an emergency on the launch pad. The Long March 10 booster also completed two test-firings on the launch pad prior to the in-flight abort test. At the same time, Chinese engineers have run a prototype lunar lander through a series of ground tests. The Mengzhou spacecraft is the vehicle China will use to ferry astronauts from the Earth to the vicinity of the Moon, where crews will transfer into a lander to carry them to the lunar surface. After a short stay on the Moon, Chinese astronauts will take off and rendezvous with the Mengzhou capsule to bring them home. Chinese officials say the Mengzhou spacecraft will also service the country’s space station in low-Earth orbit, replacing the Shenzhou capsule in use since the 1990s. The Mengzhou capsule has the capability for “multiple reuses,” according to CMSA. Mengzhou flights to low-Earth orbit will carry crews of up to seven astronauts, with smaller crews for lunar missions.

Credit: Liu Yang/VCG via Getty Images Mengzhou, which means “dream vessel” in Chinese, is scheduled for its first orbital test flight later this year. The spacecraft will launch on a Long March 10A rocket and dock with China’s Tiangong space station in low-Earth orbit. The Long March 10A, optimized for low-Earth orbit flights, will consist of a single reusable first-stage booster flying in combination with an upper stage. The full-size Long March 10, with 21 engines on three first-stage boosters connected together, will have the power to place payloads up to 70 metric tons into low-Earth orbit, and enough energy to propel the 26-metric-ton Mengzhou spacecraft to the Moon. China’s leading state-owned space industry contractor, the China Aerospace and Science Technology Corporation (CASC), said the recovery of the Long March 10 booster after the in-flight abort test lays the foundation for “subsequent full-profile flight tests” and marks a “significant step” for China in “mastering reusable rocket technology.” “The flight test further evaluated several key technologies, including the reliability of multiple engine restarts and high-altitude ignition during the rocket’s reentry phase, adaptability to complex force and thermal environments, and high-precision navigation control during the reentry phase.” CASC oversees a sprawling industry of rocket and spacecraft manufacturers, including those responsible for designing and building the Mengzhou spacecraft and Long March 10 rocket.

Credit: China Manned Space Agency The Mengzhou capsule splashes down in the South China Sea after the in-flight abort test. Credit: China Manned Space Agency The successful splashdown and recovery of the Long March 10 booster continues a busy period for China’s reusable rocket initiatives. No fewer than 10 Chinese companies are working on reusable rockets at different levels of maturity, all seeking to match the success of SpaceX’s reusable rocket program in the United States. In December, two Chinese launch providers debuted new rockets—the Zhuque-3 and Long March 12A—with recoverable and reusable boosters. The rockets reached orbit, but their boosters missed their landings downrange from their launch pads. Several Chinese companies have also completed high-altitude “hop tests” to evaluate vertical takeoff and vertical landing technologies ahead of launching their first orbital flights. These advancements in China’s reusable rocket and lunar exploration programs come as NASA prepares to launch a crew of four astronauts on a loop around the far side of the Moon as soon as next month. A US-made lunar lander is likely still a few years away from being ready to transport crews to and from the lunar surface.

Andrew Cunningham – Feb 11, 2026 1:18 pm | 37 Apple's Home app. Credit: nurPhoto / Getty Images Apple's Home app. Credit: nurPhoto / Getty Images Text settings Story text Size Small Standard Large Width * Standard Wide Links Standard Orange * Subscribers only Learn more Minimize to nav In 2022, Apple announced it was adopting a “new Home architecture” for its smart home ecosystem to improve its performance and reliability and make it possible to support different kinds of accessories. Although it was mostly an invisible update when it worked properly, some users who attempted to switch to the new architecture when it first rolled out in iOS 16.2 ran into slow or unresponsive devices and other problems, prompting Apple to pause the rollout and re-release it as part of iOS 16.4. If you put off transitioning to the new architecture because of those early teething problems or for some other reason, Apple is forcing the issue starting today: You’ll need to update to the new Home architecture if you want to continue using the Home app, and older iOS and macOS versions that don’t support the new architecture will no longer be able to control your smart home devices. The old version of the Home app and the old Home/HomeKit architecture are no longer supported. If you’re like me, you hit an “upgrade” button in your Home app years ago and then mostly forgot about it—if you open the Home app on a modern iPhone, iPad, or Mac and don’t see an update prompt, it means you’re already using the updated architecture and don’t need to worry about it. For those who haven’t upgraded, Apple’s support document outlines what you need to do: Make sure every device you plan to use the Home app on is running a supported operating system (“iOS 16.2, iPadOS 16.2, macOS 13.1, tvOS 16.2, or watchOS 9.2 or later”), open the Home app, and tap the update prompt. Apple says that some users “may be automatically upgraded to the latest version of Apple Home,” but it didn’t specify under what circumstances an automatic switch will happen. Apple has never gone into explicit detail on just what the updated Home architecture does, but the additions the company has made to its Home (formerly HomeKit) ecosystem in the last couple of years generally work only with the updated architecture and app. According to Apple’s support page, that includes “guest access, robot vacuum cleaners, and Activity History in the Home app.” For features that require a “home hub,” like sharing control of a home with other Apple users, receiving notifications, or adding accessories compatible with the Matter smart home standard, switching to the new architecture will also require you to have a HomePod (either full-sized or mini) or a modern Apple TV box on your network. The old version of Home/HomeKit allowed iPads to function as home hubs, but they can’t be used that way with the new architecture.

It also appears alongside NordVPN deals featured in Engadget’s ongoing roundup of the best VPN discounts available right now, which compares offers from multiple major providers.\nThose looking for additional security tools may also want to note that NordVPN’s Complete plan bundles in extra services beyond the VPN itself. One of those is NordPass, the company’s password management app. NordPass is also discounted as part of a separate promotion, if you’re primarily looking for a password manager rather than a VPN. The Premium tier is currently 50 percent off, bringing the price down to $36 for two years. NordPass Premium adds features such as cross-device password syncing, secure password sharing and breach monitoring, which alerts users if stored credentials appear in known data leaks.\nBoth offers are available for a limited time, though Nord has not specified an end date for the promotion. If you’re still unsure whether NordVPN is right for you, it offers a 30-day money-back guarantee, so you can change your mind and get a full refund. \n\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/nordvpn-deal-get-two-years-of-the-complete-plan-for-70-percent-off-123000517.html?src=rss",

The platform's terms of service used to note that it could collect approximate locations, but the sale to US investors looks to have changed that to precise locations.\nThis is an opt-in feature, despite the app potentially collecting this data whether the feed is activated or not. The feed is set to \"off\" by default, but can be changed via a trip to settings.\n\nThe local feed doesn't show your neighbors or people you might vibe with to help solve that pesky loneliness epidemic. Instead, it prioritizes local businesses and will highlight nearby events, shopping suggestions and restaurants to try.\n\nTikTok\n\nThis looks to be part of a broader push to attract small businesses to the app, both as content producers and as advertisers. As TechCrunch notes, this could also help insulate the company from future regulation and increased scrutiny, as it could point to the many small businesses that rely on its services. \nTikTok states that over 7.5 million businesses use the platform in the US to reach customers. However, this data is sourced from an Oxford Economics report from before a group of investors finalized a deal for the US version of the app.\nSupporting local businesses is a noble goal, but users will have to consider whether or not the value of a dedicated feed is worth the privacy risk. Oracle is a prominent investor in the new American TikTok, and company founder Larry Ellison once said \"citizens will be on their best behavior\" when they are being constantly surveilled.\nThis local feed isn't exactly a new idea. TikTok has been trying something similar in Europe since the tail-end of last year. It has shown up in the UK, France, Italy and Germany.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/tiktok-us-launches-a-local-feed-that-leverages-a-users-exact-location-170651916.html?src=rss",

The company is said to be filming the Broadway production of Stranger Things: The First Shadow so it can offer up a recording on its streaming service.\nSeveral public performances were canceled this week to accommodate filming, according to The Hollywood Reporter. They'll recommence on February 15. Filming is taking place before the original Broadway cast leaves the production next month. \n\n\n\nStranger Things: The First Shadow opened in New York City last year after debuting in London in 2023.  It’s been a critical and commercial success, and it has won multiple Tony Awards. The play is a canonical prequel to Stranger Things and it fills in more of the backstory of Henry Creel, who becomes Vecna. The show's final season digs into his past too.\nNetflix hasn't indicated when it will start streaming a recording of the play. This was inevitably going to happen at some point, though. Netflix has been busy expanding the Stranger Things universe with spin-off shows, such as the animated series Stranger Things: Tales From ‘85 (which will start streaming on April 23).

    "summary": "As frustrating as it is that governments and businesses are running roughshod over our online freedoms, at least we have plenty of good VPNs to keep us protected online. There are so many fast, intelligently designed, full-featured and affordable services on the market that the biggest problem is picking one. For any use case, you can bet at least two providers will be neck-and-neck for first place.\n \nOn the other hand, the VPN world is still the Wild West in some ways. It's easy enough to slap a cheap VPN together that the market is flooded with low-quality apps that put more money into advertising than infrastructure. They may look good, but it's all styrofoam under the hood.\n \nI built this list of the best VPNs after intensive testing to help you reorient your focus on the providers that actually deserve your time and money. Which one truly fits your needs is dependent on who you are and what you do online, but if you pick any of my seven recommendations, you can't go too far wrong. If you're interested in a service you can use without paying, head over to my list of the best free VPNs — and if you're willing to pay but want to save money, I keep a list of the best VPN deals updated weekly.\n \nFor each VPN on this list, I've shared which platforms it works on, how much it cuts into your download speed, where it offers servers, what other features are included and how much the best available deal costs. At the end, I'll list some honorable and dishonorable mentions, then answer some of the most common questions I hear about VPNs.\n \nEditor's note: This list is up-to-date as of February 2026. We intend to revisit this list every three months at a minimum, at which time our picks may be adjusted based on changes in pricing, features, testing results and other factors.\n \nTable of contents\n \n \n \nBest VPNs for 2026\n \n \nOther VPNs we tested\n \n \nWhat to look for in a VPN\n \n \nVPN FAQs\n \n \nBest VPNs for 2026\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \nOther VPNs we tested\n \nThe VPNs in this section didn't crack our top list above, but we're summarizing them here so you can see their positives and negatives as of the time of our evaluation. \n \nWindscribe\n \nWindscribe is another well-known free VPN supported by paid subscriptions. In many ways, it takes the best from both Mullvad and Proton VPN, with the former's no-nonsense privacy and the latter's healthy free plan. Without paying, you can connect to 10 of Windscribe's server locations on an unlimited number of devices at once. We've just published a full Windscribe review that can tell you more.\n \nUnfortunately, Windscribe didn't copy the most important part of Proton VPN's free plan — the unlimited data. You're only allowed to use 10GB per month, which isn't enough for regular streaming. It's also committed to a cramped and headache-inducing user interface that stands out from the crowd in all the worst ways.\n \nPrivate Internet Access\n \nPrivate Internet Access (PIA VPN) has a deeply annoying name — I assume whoever invented it also likes to hop in their Toyota Forward Motion to grab a gallon of Sustaining Cow Extract from the grocery store — but it's a worthwhile VPN whose pricing provides incredible value. Its monthly and yearly plans are good enough, but its three-year plan is the clincher. Not only is it longer than average, but you can continue to renew at the three-year level, so you won't see an unpleasant price jump the first time you re-up.\n \nPIA's apps have a dark UI reminiscent of Proton VPN, which is always a good thing. It also supports port forwarding, custom DNS and the use of a SOCKS5 or Shadowsocks proxy as a second step in the VPN connection. You can even set the maximum data packet size to help out a struggling connection, as I cover in my full PIA VPN review.\n \nThe downside is that your connection will struggle a lot. While well-designed, PIA's apps have a tendency to lag. In my most recent battery of tests, it dragged oddly on my internet in ways that weren't directly reflected in the speed tests. It's also not always capable of unblocking streaming services in other countries, and while its server network offers 152 IP address options in 84 countries, it's heavily bulked out by virtual locations.\n \nTunnelBear\n \nTunnelBear has a decent interface, which its target audience of VPN beginners will find very easy to use. Its speeds are perfectly good too, and I appreciate the depth and breadth of its transparency reports. But it's far too limited overall, with few extra features, less than 50 server locations and a free plan that caps data at 2GB per month.\n \nVyprVPN\n \nVyprVPN often flies under the radar, but it has some of the best apps in the business and a very good security record (there was a breach in 2023, but it didn't crack the VPN encryption itself). It's also got a verified privacy policy, a solid jurisdiction and runs every connection through an in-house DNS to prevent leaks.\n \nDespite all that, it didn't make the top seven because its connection speeds aren't up to scratch — you'll likely notice a bigger slowdown than average. It also has a troubling history of wild, seemingly experimental swings in its pricing and simultaneous connection limits.\n \nNorton VPN\n \nNorton VPN is part of the Norton 360 package that includes the well-known antivirus software and other security apps. It's a nice bonus if you use Norton already, but as a standalone VPN, it falls short. My tests repeatedly showed it dropping encryption and revealing my IP address whenever I switched servers, and not all of its locations managed to unblock Netflix.\n \nThis isn't to say Norton VPN is terrible. It has a fairly large server network, user-friendly apps and some cool features like an IP rotator. It also recently revamped its OpenVPN infrastructure to improve speeds on Windows. But you probably won't find those things sufficient to balance out significant speed drops on other platforms or poorly written FAQs. I especially advise against Norton VPN for Apple users, as its Mac and iPhone apps are much more limited than their Windows and Android counterparts.\n \nWhat to look for in a VPN\n \nChoosing a VPN can quickly get you mired in analysis paralysis. We're here to help, but since only you know your particular needs, you should know the major red and green flags so you can make the final call yourself. Every reputable VPN provider offers a free trial or refund guarantee you can use to run the tests below. For more advice and dangers to look for, check out my article on how to tell if your VPN is working.\n \nCompatibility: First, make sure your VPN works on all the platforms you plan to use it on. Most VPNs have apps for Windows, Mac, Android and iOS, but those apps aren't always created equal — check that the app for your chosen OS is user-friendly and has all the features you need.\n \nSpeed: Use a speed testing app to see how fast your internet is before and after connecting to the VPN (I use Ookla's speedtest.net). To check security, look up your IP address while connected to a VPN server and see if it's actually changed your virtual location. Be sure it's using expert-vetted protocols like OpenVPN, WireGuard and IKEv2. Try connecting to streaming services and seeing whether the VPN changes the available content.\n \nBackground: Do some outside research into the VPN's origins, especially its parent company, privacy policy and any past incidents. It's a dealbreaker if you can't figure out where the VPN is headquartered (which indicates a lax approach to transparency) or if it seems to have never passed a real third-party audit.\n \nServer network: Look at the server network to make sure the VPN has locations near you and in any countries where you'll want an IP address — e.g. if you need a VPN to unblock Canadian Netflix, look for multiple server locations in Canada.\n \nCustomer Service: I also advise testing the customer support options by looking for the answer to a straightforward question. If phone support (versus email and chat) is important to you, make sure to prioritize that — and make sure it's available at convenient times in your timezone.\n \nPricing: Finally, check prices. See if the VPN is affordable and decide whether you're comfortable taking a long-term subscription for better savings. If you do get a multi-year plan, check what price it will renew at, since many of the cheapest subscriptions are only introductory deals.\n \nVPN FAQs\n \nTo wrap up, let's answer some of the most common questions we get about VPNs. Feel free to get in touch if you have a query I don't cover here.\n \nWhat is a VPN?\n \nVPN stands for virtual private network. There are a few different types of VPNs, including corporate VPNs like Cisco AnyConnect, Perimeter81 and NordLayer, which are used to access a single network securely. For this list, though, we're talking about commercial services that let individual users access the internet with an assumed identity.\n \nWhenever you get online, you're assigned an IP address — a digital nametag that tells websites where to send the information you request. For an IP address to work, it needs to be unique, which means it's possible to create a record of what an individual does online.\n \nWhen you use a VPN, all the data you send to the internet goes through one of the VPN's servers before heading to its final destination. The VPN encrypts the connection between your computer and its server so the data won't trace back to you. Any website, ISP or third party that cares to look will only see the VPN's IP address, not yours. If you're interested in more detail, I've written a whole article on how a VPN works.\n \nWhat are some things VPNs are used for?\n \nThe three main use cases for a commercial VPN are security, privacy and entertainment. Using a VPN conceals your real IP address from anyone who might want to use it for nefarious purposes like cyberstalking, DDoS attacks or deducing your real location. It also keeps your ISP from profiling you for ads based on where you live or what you do online.\n \nOne side effect of borrowing a VPN's IP address is that you can make it appear as though your connection is coming from another country. You can use this to access streaming content and platforms that are only available in certain regions due to copyright. Changing your location can even get you better prices when shopping online.\n \nLocation spoofing can also be used to get online in countries that censor internet access, like China and Russia, as well as certain US states or countries — like the UK — that are adding barriers like age-gating to previously unfettered online access. All you have to do is connect to a neighboring country (or locality) where the internet isn't blocked. If you plan to do this while traveling, make sure you have the VPN downloaded before you go, as some nations prevent you from even loading a VPN's homepage. Make sure you check with local laws regarding the legality of VPN use as well — just because your VPN traffic is encrypted doesn't mean that authorities can't detect that it's being used in a given location.\n \nAre VPNs worth it?\n \nWhether a VPN is worth the price depends on how much you value those three use cases above. It's no secret that your personal information is profitable for a lot of people, from illicit hackers to corporations to law enforcement. A VPN will not make you completely anonymous, nor is it a license to commit crimes (see the next question) but it will give you a lot more control over what you transmit to the world.\n \nWith entertainment, the value is even clearer. You can use a VPN to fight back against streaming balkanization by getting more shows and movies out of a single platform — for example, a lot of shows that have been kicked off American Netflix are still on Netflix in other countries.\n \nWhat information does a VPN hide?\n \nA VPN does not make it impossible for you to be unmasked or taken advantage of online. It prevents you from passively leaking information, keeps your IP address undiscoverable on public wi-fi networks and gets you around online censorship.\n \nHowever, if you share personal information of your own volition, there's nothing the VPN can do. If you reveal your password in a social media post or click a link in a phishing email, that information bypasses the VPN. Likewise, if you do anything sensitive while logged into an account, the account holder will have that information even if you're using a VPN.\n \nA VPN is a critical part of your online security, but it can't do the whole job by itself. Healthy passwords, malware scanners, private search engines and common sense all have roles to play. Never forget, too, that using a VPN means trusting the VPN provider with access to information that's concealed from everyone else — make sure you trust the privacy policy before signing up.\n \nAre VPNs safe?\n \nAs far as we can determine, all the VPNs recommended in this story are safe to use. As with anything you subscribe to online, due diligence is important, but there's very little inherent risk; generally, the worst thing a bad VPN will do is fail to work, leaving you no worse off than before.\n \nAll that said, there are some VPNs (usually offered for free) that transmit malware, and others that pretend to be independent services while all secretly working off the same backend. Always make sure to look up any complaints or warnings about a service before you download it.\n \nCan you get a VPN on your phone?\n \nAbsolutely — almost every VPN has apps for both desktop and mobile devices. A good VPN will redesign its app to be mobile-friendly without dropping too many features. Both iOS and Android natively support VPN connections, so you're free to choose whichever provider you like.\n \nWhat about Google's One VPN?\n \nGoogle One VPN was, as you might expect, a VPN provided by Google. It was launched in 2020 for Google One subscribers and discontinued in 2024 due to lack of use. If you really want a Google VPN, you can still get one if you have certain Pixel models or if you're a Google Fi subscriber.\n \nThat said, I don't recommend using a VPN from Google even if you do still have access to one. Google is one of the worst big tech companies at protecting user privacy. While its VPN might not leak, I wouldn't trust it to guard your sensitive information.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/best-vpn-130004396.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "Whether it's the Seahawks' commanding Super Bowl victory or the fast-paced action of the Milan Winter Olympics, there's a lot of sportsball happening right now. It's a great time to get ahold of a virtual private network (VPN) and enjoy worldwide streaming adventures while improving your cybersecurity. By  connecting to a VPN every time you get online, you can keep your activity hidden from your ISP and anyone to whom it may sell that data — while streaming sporting events and TV dramas from across the globe.\nWe strongly recommend using a VPN, but shopping for one takes some care. If you jump on the very first deal you see, you might get stuck with a substandard app. It's also easy to end up paying more than you meant to, since otherwise respectable VPNs sometimes frame their prices in misleading ways, with advertised deals not always as available as they seem to be.\n\nEven with all those conditions, there are some great bargains on the table. Many of the best VPNs — including our top pick, Proton VPN — have deals that save you anywhere from 70 to 87 percent on annual subscriptions. If you can believe it, there are even Valentine's Day sales running right now, because nothing is more romantic than taking care of your online privacy.\nBest VPN deals\n\n\nExpressVPN Basic — $68.40 for a two-year subscription with four months free (81 percent off): This is one of the best VPNs, especially for new users, who will find its apps and website headache-free on all platforms. In tests for my ExpressVPN review, it dropped my download speeds by less than 7 percent and successfully changed my virtual location 14 out of 15 times. In short, it's an all-around excellent service that only suffers from being a little overpriced — which is why I'm so excited whenever I find it offering a decent deal. This discount, which gets you 28 months of ExpressVPN service, represents a 81 percent savings. Be aware, though, that it'll renew at the $99.95 per year price.\nExpressVPN Advanced — $88.00 for a two-year subscription with four months free (77 percent off): ExpressVPN recently split its pricing into multiple tiers, but they all still come with similar discounts for going long. In addition to top-tier VPN service, advanced users get two additional simultaneous connections (for a total of 12), the ExpressVPN Keys password manager, advanced ad and tracker blocking, ID protection features and a 50 percent discount on an AirCove router. As above, note that it renews at $119.95 annually.\nNordVPN Basic — $81.36 for a two-year subscription (70 percent off): NordVPN gets the most important parts of a VPN right. It's fast, it doesn't leak any of your data and it's great at changing your virtual location. I noted in my NordVPN review that it always connects quickly and includes a support page that makes it easy to get live help. NordVPN includes a lot of cool features, like servers that instantly connect you to Tor. This deal gives you 70 percent off the two-year plan, but note that it renews at $139.08 per year.\nNordVPN Plus — $93.36 for a two-year subscription (74 percent off): NordVPN has taken 74 percent off its Plus subscription. For only a little more, you get a powerful ad and tracker blocker that can also catch malware downloads, plus access to the NordPass password manager. A Plus plan also adds a data breach scanner that checks the dark web for your sensitive information. When this plan renews, you'll be paying $179.88 per year.\nSurfshark Starter — $53.73 for a two-year subscription with three months free (87 percent off): This is the \"basic\" level of Surfshark, but it includes the entire VPN; everything on Surfshark One is an extra perk. With this subscription, you'll get some of the most envelope-pushing features in the VPN world right now. Surfshark can rotate your IP constantly to help you evade detection — it even lets you choose your own entry and exit nodes for a double-hop connection. That all comes with a near-invisible impact on download speeds. With this year-round deal, you can save 87 percent on 27 months of Surfshark.\nSurfshark One — $61.83 for a two-year subscription with three months free (87 percent off): A VPN is great, but it's not enough to protect your data all on its own. Surfshark One adds several apps that boost your security beyond just VPN service, including Surfshark Antivirus (scans devices and downloads for malware) and Surfshark Alert (alerts you whenever your sensitive information shows up in a data breach), plus Surfshark Search and Alternative ID from the tier below. This extra-low deal gives you 88 percent off all those features. If you bump up to Surfshark One+, you'll also get data removal through Incogni, but the price jumps enough that it's not quite worthwhile in my eyes.\nCyberGhost — $56.94 for a two-year subscription with four months free (84 percent off): CyberGhost has some of the best automation you'll see on any VPN. With its Smart Rules system, you can determine how its apps respond to different types of Wi-Fi networks, with exceptions for specific networks you know by name. Typically, you can set it to auto-connect, disconnect or send you a message asking what to do. CyberGhost's other best feature is its streaming servers — I've found both better video quality and more consistent unblocking when I use them on streaming sites. Currently, you can get 28 months of CyberGhost for 79 percent off the usual price, but it'll renew at $56.94 per year.\nhide.me — $69.99 for a two-year subscription with four months free (75 percent off): Hide.me is an excellent free VPN — in fact, it's my favorite on the market, even with EventVPN and the free version of Proton VPN as competition. If you do want to upgrade to its paid plan, though, the two-year subscription offers great savings. Hide.me works well as a no-frills beginner VPN, with apps and a server network it should frankly be charging more for. It also comes with a guarantee that it'll renew at exactly the same length and pricing.\nWindscribe — $69 for a one-year subscription (32 percent off): It's not nearly as steep a discount as some of the others on this list, but Windscribe was cheap to begin with, so 32 percent off its monthly price is a bigger savings than it might seem. As I just covered in a detailed Windscribe review, it's worth upgrading from the free service to get full access to Windscribe's all-real server network (and remove the free plan's data cap).\nPrivate Internet Access — $79 for a three-year subscription with four months free (83 percent off): With this deal, you can get 40 months of Private Internet Access (PIA) for a little bit under $2 per month — an 83 percent discount on its monthly price. You can also get a shorter one-year subscription for $40 ($3.33 per month). Despite being so cheap, PIA has plenty of features, coming with its own DNS servers, a built-in ad blocker and automation powers to rival CyberGhost. However, internet speeds can fluctuate while you're connected.\nWhat makes a good VPN deal\nPractically every VPN heavily discounts its long-term subscriptions year-round, with even sharper discounts around occasions like the holidays. The only noteworthy exception is Mullvad, the Costco hot dog of VPNs (that's a compliment, to be clear). When there's constantly a huge discount going on, it can be hard to tell when you're actually getting a good deal. The best way to squeeze out more savings is to look for seasonal deals, student discounts or exclusive sales like Proton VPN's coupon for Engadget readers.\nOne trick VPNs often use is to add extra months onto an introductory deal, pushing the average monthly price even lower. When it comes time to renew, you usually can't get these extra months again. You often can't even renew for the same basic period of time — for example, you may only be able to renew a two-year subscription for one year. If you're planning to hold onto a VPN indefinitely, check the fine print to see how much it will cost per month after the first renewal, and ensure that fits into your budget.\nFollow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-best-vpn-deals-up-to-87-percent-off-protonvpn-surfshark-expressvpn-nordvpn-and-more-120056484.html?src=rss",

The EPA is revoking the finding for legal, not scientific, reasons. Marianne Lavelle, Inside Climate News – Feb 11, 2026 10:10 am | 105 Credit: Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post via Getty Images Credit: Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post via Getty Images Text settings Story text Size Small Standard Large Width * Standard Wide Links Standard Orange * Subscribers only Learn more Minimize to nav Following three of the warmest years on record, as scientists reckon with climate tipping points and states and cities grapple with the escalating cost of extreme weather and more intense wildfires, the Trump administration this week is expected to formally eliminate the US government’s role in controlling greenhouse gas pollution. By revoking its 17-year-old scientific finding that greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare, the Environmental Protection Agency will demolish the legal underpinning of its authority to act on climate change under the Clean Air Act. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin will be alongside President Donald Trump for an event Wednesday focused on boosting US use of coal, as mercury and air toxics standards are repealed. That is expected to be a prelude to Zeldin finalizing the endangerment finding repeal, an assignment the president handed him in an executive order signed on the first day of his second term in office. “President Trump will be taking the most significant deregulatory actions in history to further unleash American energy dominance and drive down costs,” White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said Tuesday. The move marks a far more radical retreat on climate change compared to the steps to weaken regulations that were taken in Trump’s first term. Instead, Zeldin’s team has asserted that the EPA never had the power to write such rules to begin with. Climate action advocates and Democrat-led states have vowed to challenge the repeal of the endangerment finding, a decision that not only erases President Joe Biden’s most important climate regulations, but is designed to make it more difficult for any future administration to rein in fossil fuel pollution from vehicles, power plants, or other industries. “Communities across the country will bear the brunt of this decision—through dirtier air, higher health costs, and increased climate harm,” said Michelle Roos, executive director of the Environmental Protection Network, a group of former EPA employees, in a statement. “The Trump EPA is surrendering its responsibility, turning its back on families and communities already facing the highest pollution and health risks, and dismantling decades of science and progress.” Said Joseph Goffman, EPA’s top air official during the Biden administration, “This move is a fundamental betrayal of EPA’s responsibility to protect human health. It is legally indefensible, morally bankrupt, and completely untethered from the scientific record.” The battle seems destined to land in the Supreme Court, forcing it to revisit its landmark 2007 ruling that greenhouse gases were pollutants under the Clean Air Act. The outcome of a legal challenge is by no means clear, with all five of the justices who formed the majority in that case, Massachusetts v. EPA, dead or retired. To help readers sort through the meaning of the highly technical legal maneuver by the Trump administration, and look to what comes next, Inside Climate News tackled some of the key questions raised by the reversal of the endangerment finding: Does this mean that scientists now think climate change is not a problem? A panel of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) put it bluntly: “The evidence for current and future harm to human health and welfare created by human-caused [greenhouse gases] is beyond scientific dispute,” the scientists said in a report submitted to the EPA as it launched its repeal process. They said that the endangerment finding that the Obama administration adopted in 2009 is now supported by longer observational records and multiple new lines of evidence. The most recent National Climate Assessment in 2023 reported that temperatures in the contiguous United States had increased by 2.5° F (1.4° C) since 1970, a marked increase from the 1.3° F (0.7° C) warming over the 20th century that the EPA reported in 2009. Annual heat-wave frequency has tripled since the 1960s, storms are producing more intense rains, and wildfires have become more severe. Hurricanes have been intensifying more rapidly since the early 1980s, and they break up slower. “Multiple lines of evidence show that greenhouse gas emissions from human activities are the primary driver of the observed long-term warming trend and other changes in Earth’s energy balance,” the NASEM panel said. “Natural forces cannot account for observed changes.” The Trump administration didn’t ask NASEM for input, even though the Clean Air Act indicates that the EPA should consult with the National Academies on scientific issues. Instead, NASEM had to self-fund and fast-track its work to meet the tight deadline set for public comment last September. The group noted that it worked in the wake of a slew of climate-driven disasters in the United States: “the heavy rainfall of Hurricane Helene that destroyed homes and roads in the mountains of North Carolina, the fast-moving wildfires that displaced thousands in Los Angeles and affected air quality for miles around, and the rapid flooding of the Guadalupe River in central Texas that led to at least 135 fatalities.” Such manifestations, and analytical methods that have allowed researchers to attribute them to climate change, are the most significant evolution in climate understanding since 2009, said Phil Duffy, chief scientist for the nonprofit group Spark Climate Solutions. “The evidence for societal harms from greenhouse gas emissions has become more of a present day reality than something that’s predicted and expected,” he said. Duffy, a top science adviser to President Joe Biden, was not involved in the NASEM report but was author of a peer-reviewed 2019 study that also found the scientific support for the endangerment finding had withstood the test of time. When asked about the National Academies’ work, the EPA has stressed that its decision was based on new legal doctrines. In its proposal last year, the EPA asserted that the uncertainties “are more significant than previously believed,” and that “the more pessimistic assumptions” in the 2009 finding have not been borne out. “We expect EPA to revoke the endangerment finding for legal reasons, not scientific ones.” — Jeff Holmstead, a former EPA official It was not immediately clear whether the agency, in its final proposal, would continue to lean on the well-worn science denial talking points compiled by the so-called “Climate Working Group,” five prominent climate skeptics hand-picked by Energy Secretary Chris Wright, a former oil executive, as advisors for the endangerment finding repeal process. More than 85 climate scientists submitted a report to the EPA detailing errors in the Climate Working Group’s report, and a federal judge ruled that Wright broke the law in establishing the group without regard to the Federal Advisory Committee Act’s transparency and fairness provisions. In its original proposal, the Trump EPA relied on recent Supreme Court decisions it said restrict its authority to act on climate under current law, and close observers expect that will be the administration’s strategy. “We expect EPA to revoke the endangerment finding for legal reasons, not scientific ones,” said Jeff Holmstead, a partner at the Bracewell law firm who served as head of EPA’s air office during President George W. Bush’s administration. “This is the only way that they can ‘drive a stake through the heart of climate religion,’ as Administrator Zeldin has said.” If this is about law and not science, how has the law changed since 2009? The second Trump administration had the confidence to take on the endangerment finding largely because of how the president reshaped the Supreme Court in his first term, legal experts say. In two 6-3 decisions from a conservative majority bolstered by Trump’s three appointees, the justices created new doctrine that limited the power of federal regulatory agencies like the EPA. “We’ve had an administrative law revolution,” said industry lawyer Matthew Leopold, who was the EPA’s general counsel in Trump’s first term, speaking at a forum last fall at the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), a conservative think tank. “The playing field that the Obama administration was playing on [when it made the endangerment finding] looks entirely different today.” The Supreme Court struck down Obama’s signature climate policy, the Clean Power Plan, in 2022. And in that case, West Virginia v. EPA, the court established its so-called “major questions doctrine,” saying regulation of greenhouse gases was an issue of such great economic and political significance that the EPA could not regulate them without explicit direction from Congress. Then, in a 2024 case over fishing regulations, the Supreme Court overturned the principle that had guided regulatory law for 40 years, saying that federal agencies were due no deference in interpreting ambiguities in the law. The court said judges, not agencies, should decide the meaning of the law, even though in the environmental realm that typically involves application of science and knowledge of the best available technologies for reining in pollution. Climate action advocates, however, argue that the Trump administration faces an uphill battle in defending its repeal of the endangerment finding, largely because the Supreme Court already has interpreted the Clean Air Act as applying to greenhouse gases—in Massachusetts v. EPA. The court has repeatedly declined efforts to overturn that precedent, including in the West Virginia v. EPA case. “To be sure… the court limited precisely how EPA may regulate those pollutants, but even the current court has not challenged whether EPA may do so,” said David Doniger, senior attorney and strategist for the Natural Resources Defense Council, at a briefing for reporters several weeks before the decision was announced. Doniger’s colleague, Meredith Hankins, legal director for NRDC’s climate program, says the Trump EPA is clearly relying on legal strategy since it can not offer a scientific rationale for repealing the endangerment finding. “Since EPA’s attempts to make up their own climate science has been laughed out of the room, the agency is left trying to make these tortured legal arguments that do not stand up to the slightest scrutiny,” she said. Both The Washington Post and POLITICO reported in late January that debate within the administration over the EPA’s legal approach was delaying the process. Outside the administration, even lawyers who supported the move to overturn the endangerment finding acknowledged the challenges. “They are working to break the tool itself,” said Michael Buschbacher, a top attorney in litigation against greenhouse gas standards for vehicles, speaking at the AEI endangerment finding forum. Buschbacher said the many potential pitfalls make it “like a regulatory Everest … It’s dangerous. It’s a high-risk, high-reward endeavor.” The Trump administration’s best chance of scaling that mountain is if it can make it to the Supreme Court, he said: “That’s probably where this is going to go if this administration is going to prevail.” So is this “final” decision really final? Not in the least. The EPA’s regulatory determinations are challenged in court more than those of any other federal agency, according to tracking by the Institute for Policy Integrity at New York University, and this high-stakes decision will not be an exception. Climate action advocates see the endangerment finding as a key line they must defend in what they see as the extraordinary all-out assault on environmental protection in the second Trump term. “Put simply, this is a gift-wrapped package for the fossil fuel industry,” said Manish Bapma, CEO of NRDC. “It is unscientific, it is bad economics, and it is illegal. So we’re gonna fight it.” The first stop will be the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, which has exclusive jurisdiction over appeals of nationally applicable regulations. Seven of the 11 judges on that court were appointed by Presidents Obama or Biden. How hard would it be for a future administration to restore the finding that greenhouse gas emissions are a danger to human health and the environment? It depends on the courts. If Massachusetts v. EPA is still standing at the end of the battle, the EPA will still have the power to regulate greenhouse gas emissions, like an arrow in its quiver that it just has to decide to use. But if the Supreme Court were to rule the Clean Air Act gives the EPA no authority over greenhouse gas emissions—reversing the Massachusetts decision and perhaps later cases that relied upon it—that leaves future administrations with an empty quiver. “Then there would be the problem of a lack of authority, unless Congress wrote a new law,” said Doniger of NRDC. But it has been more than two decades since a bipartisan consensus on climate action seemed fleetingly within reach in Congress. Congressional action has grown more elusive even as public support for action—especially deployment of clean energy—has grown. Democrats were able to get a $390 billion investment in clean energy, the Inflation Reduction Act, passed without GOP support in 2022. The Biden climate plan was a carrot-and-stick approach to drive the United States to cut its carbon emissions 50 percent by 2030. The IRA’s incentives and subsidies were meant to drive down the price of clean energy, while EPA regulation pushed industry to make a transition away from fossil fuels. But over the past year, Trump and the Republican Congress have clawed back the IRA’s carrots. By revoking its endangerment finding, the EPA will also drop its stick. Holmstead argued that withdrawal of the endangerment finding might actually force Congress to try to reach a bipartisan agreement on climate legislation: “The business community would like to have the long-term certainty that would come with bipartisan legislation, and if the environmental community sees that it can’t get what it wants from EPA, they might be more willing to make the kind of compromises that are always required to pass meaningful legislation.” But Holmstead added that he did not expect that to happen during the Trump administration. No matter the outcome of the coming litigation over the endangerment finding repeal, the fossil fuel industry has won time. The Trump administration has ensured that the nation that has contributed the most to the atmosphere’s overload of climate pollution, the United States, will be entangled in litigation during years that scientists have said are crucial for driving down the pollution that is increasing risks and costs for communities as it alters the planet.

To use it, you search for a supported grocery store on the home screen of the app and tap the new Cart Assistant icon that appears at the top of the screen.\n\nFrom there, you can either manually type out a shopping list or upload a photo of a handwritten one, and Cart Assistant will fetch your requested items and add them to your basket. A screenshot of ingredients needed for a recipe will also suffice.\nUber says its AI assistant will factor in availability before selecting an item and will also display prices and any available promotions. If you don’t want something it recommends, you can delete or swap it for something else. Anything you forgot to add in the original list can be added later, and if you’ve purchased something in the past, these familiar items will be prioritized so you’re less likely to need to make changes. Uber advises users that the new shopping feature is in beta right now, so might not perform perfectly. \nCart Assistant is the latest development in the gradual AI-ification of Uber Eats.

    "pubDate": "Wed, 11 Feb 2026 14:00:00 +0000",
    "source": "Engadget is a web magazine with obsessive daily coverage of everything new in gadgets and consumer electronics",
    "summary": "Pokémon Pokopia can be described as a pocket monster-themed take on Animal Crossing with a hint of Stardew Valley thrown in for good measure. And if you're like me, that alone is probably enough to sell you on the game. However, after getting a chance to play a preview of it for around half an hour, it became immediately clear that the game's coziness levels are off the charts, but it also offers some fun twists on the genre.\nCo-developed by The Pokémon Company, GAME FREAK and KOEI TECMO, instead of playing as a generic trainer, you take control of a lonely Ditto who wakes up in a cave only to be greeted by Professor Tangrowth, the last surviving inhabitant of what used to be a bustling town. While the professor might look like an extra-large version of the original pokémon with glasses, its role is to guide you as you rebuild and hopefully repopulate the surrounding area.\nOne of the best things about Pokopia is actually being able to talk to the other 'mons.\nNintendo\n\nAs a Ditto, you naturally have the ability to transform into other Pokémon, though the process is sort of incomplete, meaning you can only learn one skill from the monsters you befriend instead of their entire moveset like in the mainline games. This is where the first twist on the traditional life sim comes in. Instead of crafting them or earning money to buy tools, you can transform into other Pokémon (like Lapras or Dragonite) to use their abilities to traverse obstacles or shape the world around you. For example, turning into a Squirtle lets you shoot a water gun that will revitalize dry patches or thirsty plants, while transforming into a Scyther lets you slice through objects similar to the HM Cut. \nFrom there, you can use these skills to do things like create clusters of shrubs that will serve as homes for other Pokémon, allowing you to entice fellow creatures to return to the once desolate landscape. Another twist I really appreciate is that after appearing, new monsters will give you quests or just hang out. They will even talk and respond, and I don't mean like the 8-bit cries from other Pokémon games. They speak in full sentences, which is a wonderful departure from previous titles that really gives you the feeling that you're making friends and rebuilding a community instead of just being on a crusade to catch them all. \n\n\n\nThe Stardew Valley part of the equation comes into play after you leave the first tutorial area and you come upon an abandoned Pokémon Center that's in dire need of a renovation. You can do things like collect materials and do more quests to clean up the area to eventually turn the building in the heart of the town. Unfortunately, that's where my preview ended, aside from quickly hopping into a multiplayer session where I was able to see a much more developed village, complete with multiple buildings, roads and benches. You know, all the sorts of things you used to furnish and decorate your island with in Animal Crossing. \nThis gave me a nice glimpse at just how many things you can build in Pokopia and how easy it is to visit other people's towns. However, it didn't answer some of my bigger questions about the game, like what's the deal with Peakychu and Mosslax, whom we've seen before in previous trailers. Are they just one-off versions of existing ‘mons with unusual typings (i.e. ghost and grass) only for this game, or are they going to be a bigger part of the Pokémon world going forward? Perhaps more importantly, it was hard to tell if there will be any sort of PVE content like The Mines or Skull Cavern in Stardew Valley. I'm really hoping there is because it seems like Ditto's abilities could translate quite seamlessly to spelunking or battling your way through dungeons in search of rare items or building materials. \nI love how derpy Ditto looks when it transforms into other Pokémon. \nNintendo\n\nThat said, just being able to build a community of friendly monsters while injecting life back into a forgotten town has good vibes radiating from every corner. So if you need a super cozy game to keep you busy this winter/spring, Pokémon Pokopia is shaping up to be the digital version of a fluffy blanket and a cup of hot chocolate filled to the brim with all of your favorite 'mons. \nPokémon Pokopia is available for pre-order now, with official sales slated for March 5.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/pokemon-pokopia-is-so-damn-cozy-140000954.html?src=rss",

In its notice, the FAA also restricted air space extended in a radius of 10 nautical miles from the airport. Violators were subject to being shot down, the agency said. However, less than 10 hours later and without any additional explanation, the FAA ended the restrictions. “The temporary closure of airspace over El Paso has been lifted,” the federal agency said on social media. “There is no threat to commercial aviation. All flights will resume as normal.” Later on Wednesday morning, Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy said the decision to close airspace was made to counteract drones from cartels. “The FAA and DOW acted swiftly to address a cartel drone incursion,” Duffy wrote on X. “The threat has been neutralized, and there is no danger to commercial travel in the region.” Creating confusion In announcing the closure on Tuesday night, the FAA offered no explanation for the closure aside from determining that the area was classified as “national defense airspace,” and adding that the United States government may use “deadly force” against any airborne aircraft. According to reporting from The New York Times, local officials in El Paso and statewide were not given advance notice for the air space closure. Similarly, in announcing an end to the restrictions, the federal agency offered no immediate information to local officials or travelers who were inconvenienced. It is rare for airspace over a major airport to be closed for any extended period. The El Paso airport serves more than 3 million customers a month, and according to the 2020 US Census, it lies in the 22nd most populous city in the United States. El Paso is located along the US border with Mexico, across the Rio Grande River from Ciudad Juárez, a city of 1.5 million people. The initial lack of communication from federal officials regarding such a disruptive closure, and then its abrupt end, raised serious questions about the coordination among federal agencies, especially if the FAA was making the closure on behalf of another federal body, such as the US Department of Defense. This story was updated at 10:50 am ET to reflect the most recent statement from Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy.

    "summary": "Mullvad, a virtual private network (VPN) named after the Swedish word for \"mole,\" is often recognized as one of the best VPNs for privacy. I put it on my best VPN list for exactly that reason. I've got huge respect for the extra lengths Mullvad goes to in order to ensure its user's privacy.\nTo give you a preview, Mullvad is one of the few VPNs — other than my normal privacy recommendation, Proton VPN — that lets users pay entirely in cash. But even Proton VPN asks for an email address to make an account and uses a few marketing cookies on its own website. Mullvad represents every account as a randomly generated 16-digit code and uses no marketing cookies whatsoever.\nThat's just one example of how Mullvad goes beyond the call of duty to keep users private. But while privacy is the most important aspect of a VPN alongside security, it's not the only thing that matters. For this review, I set out to investigate whether Mullvad pairs its rights-protecting bonafides with versatile, convenient and enjoyable VPN apps. Using our rigorous VPN testing procedure, I'll rate Mullvad in 11 areas. You can find a summary of my results in the table below, skip to the sections that matter most to you or just read my final advice in the conclusion.\nEditor's note (2/11/26): We've overhauled our VPN coverage to provide more detailed, actionable buying advice. Going forward, we'll continue to update both our best VPN list and individual reviews (like this one) as circumstances change. Most recently, we added official scores to all of our VPN reviews. Check out how we test VPNs to learn more about the new standards we're using.\n\nFindings at a glance\nCategory\n\n   \nNotes\n\n  \nInstallation and UI\n\n   \nAll apps share roughly the same user interface\nApps are responsive and easy to navigate, with no design choices that would threaten beginners\nLack of \"fastest server\" button is an issue\nBrowser extension is only available on Firefox and still in beta\n\n  \nSpeed\n\n   \nReasonably good average latency\nReduces download speeds by 26 percent and upload speeds by 17 percent\nSpeed declines are consistent and chartable\nAll speed metrics are quite good on nearby servers\n\n  \nSecurity\n\n   \nOnly uses WireGuard protocol\nNo IP address leaks, even when switching servers\nPacket test showed successful encryption\n\n  \nPricing\n\n   \nAlways costs 5 Euro per month, though prices outside Europe depend on exchange rates\nNo auto-renewal — membership lasts until money runs out\nCan pay using cash or by purchasing scratch-off vouchers on Amazon\n14 day money-back guarantee, except on cash payments\n\n  \nBundles\n\n   \nOnly app besides the VPN is the free Mullvad Browser, which removes the tracking habits of typical web browsers\nAllows several smaller VPNs to use its servers in their networks\n\n  \nPrivacy policy\n\n   \nNo vague lines or loopholes in privacy policy\nOnly saves account numbers and expiration dates for each user\nUses an extremely limited range of cookies with no marketing trackers\nHas undergone a total of 17 audits of different aspects of its service\nSwedish police demanded customer information in 2023; Mullvad couldn't comply because the data wasn't logged\n\n  \nVirtual location change\n\n   \nUnblocked Netflix 13 out of 15 times\nWhen it failed, virtual location was still changed\n\n  \nServer network\n\n   \n90 locations in 50 countries, majority in North America and Europe\nNo virtual servers whatsoever\n\n  \nFeatures\n\n   \nDAITA conceals traffic patterns that might let an AI identify what sites you visit\nUses quantum-resistant encryption on WireGuard\nCan choose your own multihop entry and exit points\nSeveral options for getting around nation-level firewalls\nCan block ads, trackers, malware and other unwanted content using predetermined DNS block lists\nSupports IPv6 traffic\nKill switch and stronger lockdown mode\nSplit tunneling by app\n\n  \nCustomer support\n\n   \nHelp center includes useful filters to find the topic\nWell-written articles with good internal linking\nNo live chat support, but staff answers emails quickly\nCan view app logs at any time\n\n  \nBackground check\n\n   \nFounded in 2009 in Sweden; still owned and operated by initial founders\nUser account numbers were exposed in a 2023 incident, but Mullvad quickly closed the leak\n\n  \nInstalling, configuring and using Mullvad\nLet's start by examining how Mullvad feels as a piece of software. In this section, I'll be testing its desktop apps for Windows and Mac, its mobile apps for Android and iOS and its browser extension for Firefox. To start with the installation process, Mullvad downloads and installs in a snap on mobile. On desktop, installation requires a few more steps than is typical, but the app guides you quickly through everything.\nAcross the board, my only serious complaint is that there's no option for automatically choosing the fastest server. You can usually assume that the nearest one to you will be the fastest, but there's always the chance of an unusual server overload. It's a bizarre oversight for an app that otherwise goes out of its way to be usable.\nWindows\nMullvad's Windows app has a slim UI that uses space efficiently without being too cramped. It doesn't give you a lot of information, such as live speed tests or data in transit, but I've mostly found that to be needless filler on VPN apps.\nSpeaking of needless filler, the map may be a little bigger than it needs to be, but maps on VPN clients aren't just about teaching you geography — they do a lot to make the apps more welcoming to casual users who might not otherwise fire up security software. In fact, Mullvad's UI is admirably beginner-friendly, befitting its focus on privacy for everybody rather than just the tech-savvy.\nAll the settings are accessed by clicking the gear in the top-right. Here, you can turn on DAITA (Mullvad's defense against AI traffic scanning), activate multihop and control Mullvad's other features. There are also some quality-of-life features for the UI itself, such as whether it remains pinned to the taskbar or operates as a standalone window. Some options, especially under the VPN settings tab, are a bit technical, but don't need to be touched for a good experience.\nMac\nMullvad's macOS app is quite similar to its Windows app, both in terms of the interface and the features offered. The big difference used to be that macOS lacked split tunneling, but that's been added in a recent update. The only serious distinction now is that the Mac client can't be unpinned from the taskbar, which is just a little bothersome.\nOther than that, you'll find every setting you need under the gear, just like on Windows. Similarly, connections to VPN servers happen quickly, and selecting locations from the menu is very straightforward. While connected on either app, you can click the circular arrow by your location to swap to another server in the same location — highly convenient if you're trying to unblock Netflix.\nAndroid\nMullvad's Android app has the same nearly-perfect design approach as all its other apps. The main page has nothing on it but the connect/disconnect button, the choice of server locations, a map and the buttons for your account information and preferences. Those preferences are a manageable set of options that are almost all managed with simple on-off switches. It's all highly responsive and annoyance-free.\niOS\nMullvad's iOS app looks very similar to its apps on every other platform. The front page is kept simple, with large controls in the foreground and a map taking up most of the space. Everything else is located in the menu accessed through the gear icon at top right. Neither mobile app has the options for toggling the UI itself that the desktop apps have, but it's mostly free of quality-of-life problems to start with.\nBrowser extensions\nMullvad's browser extension is only compatible with Firefox. You can't actually connect to the VPN through this extension. Its main functions are to tell you whether you're connected to a Mullvad server and to connect to a SOCKS5 proxy in a Mullvad location. If you do this while connected to Mullvad through the desktop app, you'll get a second layer of protection, similar to the multi-hop feature.\nThe Firefox extension is a rare misfire for Mullvad — perhaps fair, since it's still in beta. Its only real feature is something that the desktop app already does perfectly well, and it looks like a software malfunction to boot. However, given Mullvad's track record, I'm confident they'll figure out what to do with it in time.\nMullvad speed test\nA VPN almost always slows browsing speeds and increases latencies. It's unavoidable, given the extra steps a VPN protocol adds to the process of getting online. The trick is to find VPNs that keep the slowdown to a minimum, using a combination of regular maintenance, good planning and smart load balancing.\nFor this test, I used speedtest.net to check how six of Mullvad's server locations influenced three key speed metrics. Ping measures latency, the time in milliseconds (ms) that one data packet needs to travel between a client device and an ISP. Download speed measures the amount of data in Megabits that a web browser can download in one second. Upload speed tracks how much data can be uploaded in a second. We're looking for low latencies and high download and upload speeds.\nServer location\n\n   \nPing (ms)\n\n   \nIncrease factor\n\n   \nDownload speed (Mbps)\n\n   \nPercentage drop\n\n   \nUpload speed (Mbps)\n\n   \nPercentage drop\n\n  \nPortland, USA (unprotected)\n\n   \n15\n\n   \n—\n   \n58.96\n\n   \n—\n   \n5.85\n\n   \n—\n  \nSeattle, USA (fastest location)\n\n   \n23\n\n   \n1.5x\n\n   \n55.07\n\n   \n6.6\n\n   \n5.51\n\n   \n5.8\n\n  \nMontreal, Canada\n\n   \n165\n\n   \n11.0x\n\n   \n44.28\n\n   \n24.9\n\n   \n4.62\n\n   \n21.0\n\n  \nFortaleza, Brazil\n\n   \n307\n\n   \n20.5x\n\n   \n40.96\n\n   \n30.5\n\n   \n4.65\n\n   \n20.5\n\n  \nPrague, Czechia\n\n   \n368\n\n   \n24.5x\n\n   \n43.17\n\n   \n26.8\n\n   \n5.47\n\n   \n6.5\n\n  \nLagos, Nigeria\n\n   \n528\n\n   \n35.2x\n\n   \n37.41\n\n   \n36.6\n\n   \n4.61\n\n   \n21.2\n\n  \nBangkok, Thailand\n\n   \n473\n\n   \n31.5x\n\n   \n39.76\n\n   \n32.6\n\n   \n4.13\n\n   \n29.4\n\n  \nAverage\n\n   \n311\n\n   \n20.7x\n\n   \n43.44\n\n   \n26.3\n\n   \n4.83\n\n   \n17.4\n\n  \nI'll start with the bad news: the tests didn't exactly make Mullvad look like a speed demon. Its speeds have gone up and down in the years I've been using it, and right now they appear to be on the downswing. If you use locations all around Mullvad's server network, you can expect your download speeds to decrease by about 26 percent and your upload speeds to decline by 17 percent.\nHowever, it's important to put those numbers in perspective. First, Mullvad's numbers aren't markedly worse than the ones I got when testing CyberGhost. Its speeds are average, but by definition, most things are average. Its average worldwide latency is actually better than Surfshark, the current champion of download and upload speeds.\nIt's also nice that Mullvad's speed drops follow a predictable curve. Lots of VPNs have unexpectedly sharp declines in certain locations, frequently in Africa. By contrast, Mullvad's speed decreases pretty much as a direct function of how far from the server you are. This not only makes speed drops easier to plan around, but also means you can expect very good speeds on nearby servers.\nThis property of being fastest on servers near the user is another sign of Mullvad's focus on its core privacy mission. If anonymity is your main reason for using a VPN, it doesn't matter what your IP address is, so long as it's not your real one. Using a nearby Mullvad server should guarantee you an internet connection that's both fast and private.\nMullvad security test\nTo be secure, a VPN has to check two critical boxes. It must provide you with a secondary IP address without leaking your real one, and it must encrypt your communications with its servers so your activity can't be traced. In the sections below, I'll see whether Mullvad meets those requirements.\nVPN protocols\nVPNs use protocols to mediate between end devices, ISPs and their own servers. The first step is to ensure that the service you're considering uses protocols that have expert confidence. Mullvad has kindly made this step easy for me by using only WireGuard on all its apps, with no OpenVPN, IKEv2 or in-house unique protocols.\nThere's no question that WireGuard is a solid protocol. It uses the ChaCha20 stream cipher for symmetric encryption and Poly1305 for authentication, both uncrackable with current technology. Mullvad has even added its own fix for WireGuard's one flaw, its need to save static IP addresses — the Mullvad implementation is set up to delete the IP address if it goes 10 minutes without being used.\nEven so, it's unfortunate to lose the ability to change protocols, which is one of the most common steps for troubleshooting a VPN connection. I understand Mullvad's reasoning for cutting out OpenVPN (it claims the cryptography isn't strong enough) but don't agree. It's one of this provider's few unforced errors.\nLeak test\nThere's a straightforward test to determine if your VPN is leaking. Load up any website that shows your IP address — I personally use ipleak.net — and see what IP and location it reveals without your VPN active. Then activate the VPN and refresh the page. If you see your real IP address anywhere, your VPN is leaking.\nI ran that test on five Mullvad servers. Each time, the website showed me the IP address of the VPN server, concealing my real one. To keep things simple, I ran the initial tests with IPv6 blocked via the Mullvad client. When I turned it on and tried again, the IPv6 traffic didn't leak any more than the IPv4 did. I also saw no signs of WebRTC leaks. Unless you set up a custom DNS server, Mullvad also uses its own DNS, which remains entirely within the VPN tunnel.\nI had one more leak test to try. Frequently, VPNs are leak-proof when maintaining a connection to one server but drop encryption when switching between servers. That problem is why I ultimately couldn't recommend Norton VPN. Luckily for me, Mullvad has a button that lets you shuffle to another server in the same location, so I used that to see if it stayed leak-proof.\nAs you can see in the screenshot, Mullvad jumped seamlessly from one server to another without showing my real location in-between. On a practical level, that's enough for me to declare Mullvad leak-proof.\nEncryption test\nFor one final experiment, I used the WireShark packet sniffer to see whether the data Mullvad sent from my computer to my ISP was encrypted. After capturing a few packets, I was gratified to see that they were totally unreadable to interlopers. Most established VPNs pass this test, but it's still important for due diligence.\nHow much does Mullvad cost?\nMullvad's pricing structure is one of the most unusual things about it. This is normally the section where I untangle 47 different Pro+ and Business- accounts that are all sold at three different durations. Mullvad couldn't be further from that. It costs 5 Euro a month — that’s it. Each 5-Euro subscription can be used on five devices at once.\nIt manages payments through a system inspired by parking meters. When you sign up for Mullvad, you'll buy as much time as you want. That time will count down until it expires, unless you top it up with more 5-Euro payments. If you run out of money, Mullvad won't charge you a new subscription fee because you didn't tell it not to. It'll just stop working until you pay again. Every payment also comes with a 14-day money-back guarantee, except for payments made in cash.\nThe only real complexity in the process is that Mullvad always figures out its prices in Euro, so outside the EU, the cost per month is affected by exchange rates. If you happen to live in a country where the government's economic policy shuttles between capricious and arbitrary, you might want to grab a few months in advance.\nThe other most interesting thing about Mullvad's pricing is the options you can use to pay. For maximum privacy, you can pay with cash using the payment token you'll find on your account page. Note that this is not the same as your account number. To find it, log into your dashboard on Mullvad.net, click Add time to your account in the left-hand bar, then click the button labeled Cash and scroll down. Make your cash payment by writing the token on an envelope and mailing it to Sweden (full instructions here).\nYou can also get untraceable Mullvad vouchers by paying cash at participating retail locations. Most of them are in Europe, but you can order them from Amazon. While your payment to Amazon won't be private, the voucher can't be linked directly to your VPN account, since the actual number is hidden behind a scratch-off panel. It's actually pretty ingenious.\nOf course, you can also pay using any of the normal methods, including credit cards, cryptocurrency and bank wires (though not PayPal). But the more private methods are always there for people who need them.\nMullvad side apps and bundles\nMullvad is that rare VPN that's still content to be a VPN and not an all-inclusive security suite. No shade to NordVPN or Surfshark, whose extra features are generally quite good, but it's nice to see at least one of the top providers staying focused.\nAlthough Mullvad doesn't have any partners that sell their products alongside its VPN, it does have several partnerships with other VPNs who use its network as the basis for their own products. MalwareBytes Privacy VPN, Mozilla VPN, Tailscale and Obscura can all be considered Mullvad side apps if you squint.\nMullvad Browser\nMullvad's only product other than the VPN is Mullvad Browser, which is free to download and works on Windows, macOS and Linux. Mullvad Browser works in the background, blocking common methods of browser fingerprinting that can be used to deduce your identity even when you have a VPN running.\nFor example, it automatically reports your time zone as UTC, disguises personal preferences like font and window size, scrambles information sent by APIs and conceals your browser version and computer operating system. It's also in private mode by default, which doesn't hide what your ISP sees but is useful for concealing your activity from other people that might use your computer.\nClose-reading Mullvad's privacy policy\nSince privacy is Mullvad's main selling point, this section is even more important than usual. Loopholes in the privacy policy of the privacy VPN would be deeply ironic. Fortunately, Mullvad's privacy policy backs up its high-flying rhetoric. It's a short, pointed and readable document with no problems I could discern. Mullvad has no parent company or subsidiary it might use as a loophole, and no clauses in its policy are left open to interpretation. It's a masterpiece of the privacy-policy genre.\nThe document is actually three policies: a privacy policy, a no-logging policy and a cookie policy. The privacy policy lists all the times Mullvad might collect data about a user. That's exactly two situations — using financial information to process payments (which will be entirely anonymous if you use cash or a voucher) and using your email address to track support tickets you open. That's it.\nThe no-logging policy is a bit longer, but mostly because it's explaining exactly how Mullvad manages to run a VPN service with so little information on individual users. For each account, it stores a number and an expiration date, plus public keys and tunnel addresses if you're using WireGuard (deleted at most 10 minutes after your session ends). Everything else is completely anonymized. Mullvad even claims that its 500,000 or so user accounts could have been created by the same user 500,000 times, which I suppose is one way to spend 2.5 million Euro.\nThe cookie policy is the shortest because Mullvad uses exactly five cookies. One saves your login status in your browser, one saves your language preferences, one protects its site from being used in a specific kind of forgery hack and the other two are for handling Stripe payments.\nIndependent privacy audits\nMullvad corroborates its privacy policy with regular audits of various aspects of its service. Currently, there are 17 audits listed on its website, including four infrastructure audits by Cure53. All of its apps have been separately audited and found to be solid. It has been a couple of years since the last full infrastructure audit in 2024, but given how many other targeted reviews Mullvad has gone through since then, it's hard to be too upset about the pause.\nIn 2023, Mullvad achieved the holy grail of VPN privacy: being ordered by subpoena to turn over customer information and not being able to comply because that information didn't exist. Nothing compares to a VPN's privacy being tested in the wild like this.\nCan Mullvad change your virtual location?\nSometimes, a VPN appears to be working, but still reveals your real location to websites. Netflix is a useful proxy for this. To unblock a streaming site like Netflix, a VPN needs to change your virtual location while not appearing to do so — if Netflix sees any hint of VPN traffic, you'll get blocked with the hated proxy error. I used five different locations to check whether Mullvad is up to the streaming task.\nServer location\n\n   \nUnblocked Netflix?\n\n   \nChanged content?\n\n  \nVancouver, Canada\n\n   \n3/3\n\n   \n3/3\n\n  \nGothenberg, Sweden\n\n   \n2/3\n\n   \n2/3\n\n  \nIstanbul, Turkey\n\n   \n3/3\n\n   \n3/3\n\n  \nJohannesburg, South Africa\n\n   \n3/3\n\n   \n3/3\n\n  \nSingapore, Singapore\n\n   \n2/3\n\n   \n2/3\n\n  \nMullvad did well for streaming, but it didn't manage a perfect score like its fellow anti-establishment VPN Windscribe did. Two of the 15 servers I tested failed to unblock Netflix, one in Singapore and one in Mullvad's hometown of Gothenburg. I also had trouble logging into Netflix while connected to a Vancouver server, though that server did unblock the site consistently once I got inside.\nIn Mullvad's defense, no location failed more than once. It's completely possible to get good streaming performance out of this VPN; you just have to be willing to click the server refresh button a few times. Privacy is still the main use case for Mullvad, but it's fine for streaming too.\nInvestigating Mullvad's server network\nMullvad has 90 server locations in 50 countries and territories. Unusually for a VPN, users can choose between all 590 of its total servers, including several in each location. There's even a list on its website that shows you the status of every server.\nMullvad does not use virtual server locations, so every server is physically located in the place where it claims to be. Here's how they're distributed.\nRegion\n\n   \nCountries with servers\n\n   \nTotal server locations\n\n  \nNorth America\n\n   \n3\n   \n25\n\n  \nSouth America\n\n   \n5\n   \n6\n  \nEurope\n\n   \n29\n\n   \n41\n\n  \nAfrica\n\n   \n2\n   \n2\n  \nMiddle East\n\n   \n2\n   \n2\n  \nAsia\n\n   \n7\n   \n8\n  \nOceania\n\n   \n2\n   \n6\n  \nTotal\n\n   \n50\n\n   \n90\n\n  \nOver half the countries with servers are in Europe and over two-thirds of the cities with servers are in either Europe or North America. That lopsided network is a limitation of Mullvad's refusal to use virtual server locations, since its real servers have to be concentrated in nations developed enough to host data centers. With an all-real network, it's easier to tell which servers will give you the fastest performance, but you can't simulate as much of the world as you can with larger services like ExpressVPN.\nThe good news is that there's at least two real server locations on every continent. Mullvad has a surprisingly robust presence in South America and two bare-metal servers in Africa, which is more than some other VPNs have. In the end, though, the best application of Mullvad is to protect the online privacy of users in North America, Europe and eastern Asia.\nExtra features of Mullvad\nMost of Mullvad's features are augmentations to the VPN itself, rather than side options that do other things. Some of them are bread-and-butter, like the kill switch and split tunneling, but a few you won't find anywhere else. Note beforehand that Mullvad does not support port forwarding, so if you depend on that for your torrenting, try another VPN.\nDAITA AI defenses\nMullvad's most novel feature is a recent one. DAITA, which stands for Defense against AI-guided Traffic Analysis, can be toggled on and off in the Mullvad app. According to Mullvad, certain patterns in how browsers communicate with websites can be analyzed by AI to reveal the truth behind encrypted internet history. DAITA hides those packets by filling communications with background noise so the AI won't know what's real.\nDAITA is a laudably forward-looking feature, but as Mullvad itself admits, it will make your browsing speeds slower and drain your battery. I recommend only using it for activities you really want to hide.\nQuantum resistance\nMullvad's desktop apps establish quantum-proof WireGuard tunnels by default. Quantum computing isn't yet a threat to WireGuard, but it may become dangerous in the future, so Mullvad is getting ahead of the problem (along with a few other services like NordVPN). When quantum resistance is active, Mullvad encapsulates its keys using the current standard mechanism, ML-KEM.\nAnti-censorship\nIf you find yourself in a country where government censorship makes it hard to access the internet, Mullvad has options that might help. These anti-censorship features can be used to get around firewalls that block visible VPN traffic. You have several options, including changing your WireGuard port, randomizing your port number, disguising your VPN traffic as an ordinary HTTPS connection or using an obfuscated Shadowsocks proxy.\nMullvad's anti-censorship involves more features than most VPNs have in this area. This makes it a bit less user-friendly, but a lot more likely to work. If you're new to getting around censorship, Mullvad's help center has a helpful page about using its anti-censor settings.\nMultihop\nMany VPNs offer a double-hop connection that routes your traffic through two servers instead of one, adding a redundant layer of encryption in case one server malfunctions. Mullvad pulls ahead of the competition (except Surfshark, which also does this) by allowing you to choose your entry and exit servers. When you activate the multihop option and open the server list, you'll be prompted to pick two locations instead of one.\nThis means you can select an entry server that's close to you and an exit server in any country whose location you want to spoof, letting you fine-tune your own performance. It's way nicer than being railroaded into certain paths.\nDNS content blockers\nMullvad includes six blocklists that can keep you or your family members from looking at unwanted content: ads, trackers, malware, gambling, adult content and social media. These lists can't be customized like Windscribe's R.O.B.E.R.T. blocks can, so you're limited to just turning them on and off.\nIPv6 support\nThe internet is gradually transitioning from the old IPv4 standard over to IPv6, which will allow many more addresses to be shared out. Mullvad is one of a few VPNs looking ahead to the IPv6 era. You can leave it to block all IPv6 traffic, but if you do need IPv6 for any reason, you can enable it while still being connected to a Mullvad server.\nKill switch and lockdown mode\nMullvad comes with two features that protect against unexpectedly losing your VPN defenses. The first is a kill switch, a common VPN option that cuts off internet access if the VPN tunnel ever fails. This simple measure helps guard against accidental leaks.\nLockdown mode is the stronger option. While it's active, you will be unable to get on the internet unless you connect to a Mullvad server first. This will remain true if you turn the connection off yourself and even if you quit the app.\nSplit tunneling\nSplit tunneling is available on Mullvad's apps for every system except iOS. It lets you send some apps outside the VPN tunnel so they get online with your normal IP address. It's helpful if you have some apps that don't work with the VPN active — this is common with online banking, as an example. Another common application is to protect a torrenting client in the background while using your browser unprotected for better speeds.\nMullvad customer support options\nMullvad makes two forms of support available in the app. You can report a problem by going to Settings -> Support -> Report a problem, typing your question (requested to be in either English or Swedish, though they'd probably be able to read a question run through Google Translate) and optionally providing your email. You can also view the app's logs at any time, which can be useful to help a technician diagnose your problem.\nIf you'd rather search for a solution at your own pace, you can go to that same page and click FAQs and Guides instead. This opens the help center in a browser.\nI love Mullvad's approach to laying out its FAQs. Instead of crowding topics into five or six categories and making you guess whether your problem falls under setup, usage or troubleshooting, Mullvad gives you a set of dropdown filters to narrow down the articles which might relate to your problem.\nBy the time you've named which device, OS and protocol you're dealing with, you won’t have many articles left to sift through. There is an annoying tendency for certain sets of filters to reduce the number of surfaced links to zero, but for those cases, there's a search bar that also works well.\nThe articles themselves are good enough that I referred to them several times while writing this review. Some of them are a bit overlong, but they're diligent about including both internal and external links to get you where you're going fast.\nLive support experience\nThis is normally where I cover how it feels to get live chat support from the VPN I'm reviewing. However, Mullvad doesn't have live chat support. That's unfortunate, although it's still better than Windscribe's approach of forcing you to banter with a sarcastic robot. Instead, I sent a question via email to Mullvad's support team, and got a response within 24 hours.\nMullvad background check\nMullvad was founded in 2009 in Sweden. It's still owned and operated by its original founders. According to a detailed timeline on its website, its 16-year history has been as uneventful as any user could ask for, with not much changing except updates to stay on the technological leading edge. The only controversy mentioned in Mullvad's own materials is the 2023 police raid of its headquarters, which (as I covered in the privacy section) only makes them look better.\nSo as not to take Mullvad at its word, I scoured the last 16 years of news items and user reports to search for any other blemishes on its record. Based on that research, I found no reason to doubt Mullvad's honesty about its location, owners or team.\nI found just one leak that wasn't noted on Mullvad's own site. In 2023, a security research group called ZATAZ alleged that it found anonymized information on Mullvad users saved on an Internet Archive page, including account numbers (linked article is in French). According to ZATAZ, Mullvad contacted the Archive and got the page deleted.\nTo my mind, the only mistake Mullvad made in response to the ZATAZ allegations was not making a public statement about the incident. I can see why they didn't think it was a big deal, since even logging into someone else's Mullvad account wouldn't show you their browsing history, but it's always better to communicate about these things.\nFinal verdict\nMullvad is a VPN that knows what it wants to be and achieves that goal with flying colors. It's not trying to be an everything app — it does privacy and does it well. That's not to say it has nothing going on outside the VPN itself, as its DNS blockers, AI defenses and split tunneling all work smoothly. But if you want a VPN that's not ashamed to be a VPN, Mullvad is the right choice.\nOf course, it has its own compromises. It's solidly in the middle of the speed pack and occasionally trips up when unblocking streaming sites. The lack of any protocols other than WireGuard grates on me a bit, since it reduces the user's options for troubleshooting. With all that said, those are minor hiccups on a VPN that does such a thorough job keeping you anonymous online.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/vpn/mullvad-vpn-review-near-total-privacy-with-a-few-sacrifices-130000056.html?src=rss",

Sign up here\nSomething weird struck me early on while watching the movie Iron Lung, which has so far taken $32m at the box office, despite being a grungy low-budget sci-fi thriller adapted from an independent video game few people outside of the horror gaming community have even heard of. Set after a galactic apocalypse, it follows a convict who must buy his freedom by piloting a rusty submarine through an ocean of human blood on a distant planet. Ostensibly, he’s looking for relics that may prove vital for scientific research, but what he finds is much more ghastly. So far, so strange.\nThe film was also written, directed and financed by one person – the YouTube gaming superstar Mark “Markiplier” Fischbach – who also stars. But that’s not the weird part, either. The weird part is that watching the film Iron Lung feels like watching Fischbach play Iron Lung the game. Maybe it’s the fact that he spends most of the movie sitting at the sub’s controls, trying to figure out how to use them correctly – like a gamer would. Maybe it’s that, as the film progresses, he has to solve a series of environmental puzzles linked by various codes, computer read-outs and little injections of narrative – just like in a video game. Long periods of the movie involve Fischbach trying to decide what to do next, the camera close up on his confused face. This is incredibly similar to watching his YouTube videos about playing Iron Lung, an experience he often found bewildering. It was the most metatextual experience I’ve had in the cinema since The Truman Show – but I’m not sure this is what Fischbach intended.\n Continue reading...",

    "full_text": "it’s a ripping yarn America, it’s time to think beyond leather for luxury car seats Some brands are already ahead of the curve, while others leave the US in the cold. Jonathan M. Gitlin – Feb 11, 2026 7:00 am | 69 Credit: Getty Images Credit: Getty Images Text settings Story text Size Small Standard Large Width * Standard Wide Links Standard Orange * Subscribers only Learn more Minimize to nav A long time ago, in (I believe) an issue of Car Magazine from the mid-1990s, the designer Gordon Murray shared his thoughts about a possible four-door follow-up to the McLaren F1. Road cars weren’t really his thing. Until then, his career had been focused on Formula 1 car design, and he brought that sport’s obsession with weight savings with him. Were he to design a sedan, he’d trim the interior with textile, not leather. After all, wool made fine suits and coats, Murray reasoned, and it would save weight. A four-door McLaren never happened during his tenure, nor has one appeared since. Murray now runs his own boutique hypercar company, which also builds no sedans. But the idea that high-end cars could use something other than leather has stuck with me, especially after driving BMW’s i7, which debuted in 2022 with a premium cashmere wool interior. More recently, new EVs have experimented with interesting textile alternatives to leather. Two good examples are the BMW iX3 and the Audi A6, though neither can be ordered with these textile options in the US. It’s hardly the first time US-market cars have had different options. Our Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards insist on features like side reflectors, which Europe doesn’t need, and we maintain somewhat old headlight rules. You’re also unlikely to see any of the smaller-engined versions of luxury cars from German brands being offered for North American consumption. But it did make me wonder why we’re being left in the cold. Here’s what they said When we saw a preview of the new Audi A6 in mid-2024, we were told this textile trim would not be coming to America. Credit: Audi When we saw a preview of the new Audi A6 in mid-2024, we were told this textile trim would not be coming to America. Credit: Audi We’re used to American Audis being a bit different. We couldn’t have the R8’s laser high beam headlights or the A6’s OLED animated taillights, and we’re not getting the station wagon version of that car, the A6 Avant, at all. Or the A5 Avant. I reached out to the automaker to ask why it didn’t think its American customers would go for the textile trim. An Audi USA spokesperson told Ars that “while we applaud the sustainable factor of cloth seats, customers continue to prefer leather/leather-like seats in luxury vehicles and note that it is easier to clean… [and] easier to get into and out of (i.e., ingress/egress as clothes sometimes cling to fabric seats).” Similarly, BMW doesn’t always bring its good stuff across this side of the Atlantic. There was no Z1, and the E36 M3 had a much lesser engine thanks to federal and Californian emissions regulations, just to pick two (admittedly old) examples. BMW told me that, like its counterpart Audi, its customers are mostly fine with synthetic leather-like alternatives to animal hides. “We continuously evaluate market trends, industry developments, and customer feedback when considering new features and materials,” a BMW spokesperson said. “Currently, our customers are very satisfied with our animal-free materials such as SensaTec and Veganza as well as our traditional leather options. While there has been some interest in textile materials, the demand has focused on more premium options like Alcantara and microfiber rather than traditional cloth. Accordingly, we have been expanding our range of these premium textile materials in recent years.” The BMW i7 feels very special. Credit: BMW The BMW i7 feels very special. Credit: BMW Think motorsports-inspired interiors and perhaps more plushness like in that i7, but it seems we shouldn’t expect eco seats woven from recycled plastics, unlike in Europe. What do US car buyers want? Every year, AutoPacific surveys more than 18,000 people planning to buy or lease a new car to gauge their interest in dozens of potential new features to pin down what American car buyers really want in their next vehicle. The market research company asked survey respondents about upholstery, though leather and animal-free alternatives were the options. “Expectedly, among shoppers who would consider buying a luxury vehicle, demand is the strongest for leather, followed by upgraded leather that may have quilting, accent stitching, or other seat design enhancements,” said Robby DeGraff, manager of product and consumer insights at AutoPacific. “When we shift away from real leather over to the alternatives and imitations, demand begins to fall, but not by much. For example, of those who said they would consider buying an Aston Martin, 32 percent want genuine leather or upgraded leather, while 31 percent of them would be a-OK with leatherette or a sustainable leatherette material.” “Dipping a bit more down the price ladder but still within the luxury space, there’s greater differences in demand for real leather versus imitation leather (sustainable or not), among future Cadillac buyers, Lexus, buyers, as well as future Porsche and Mercedes-Benz buyers,” DeGraff said. Indeed, Cadillac has always had a particularly American approach to the luxury car, and in its new Optiq electric crossover, that approach includes some cool textiles made entirely from recycled materials. It’s about meeting customers’ expectations, according to Jennifer Widrick, director of global colors, materials, and finishes at General Motors Design. “Cadillac specifically uses fabric as a distinct element to reinforce quality detailing, a connection to fashion, and interior design trends,” Widrick said. “Fabric provides added depth through multiple color yarns in precise constructions on surfaces that would otherwise be one color. Customers recognize these details as synonymous with quality and modernity.” The Cadillac Optiq opts for tactile textiles for its center console trim, among other places in the EV. Credit: Michael Teo Van Runkle The Cadillac Optiq opts for tactile textiles for its center console trim, among other places in the EV. Credit: Michael Teo Van Runkle You shouldn’t think of it as one material versus another, Widrick said. “Rather, the layering and customer appreciation of detailing is more discerning. In addition to the depth that fabric textures can bring to the surface of automotive interiors, they provide opportunity for a more conscious material approach,” she said. “Fabric has evolved for Cadillac in that it is no longer just a seating material but an element that is reaching out into other areas of the vehicle. It’s an exciting shift to see known materials placed in reimagined ways that create fresh interaction experiences for customers.” Harmony is key. “Shape, scale, haptic, and proportion are taken into consideration to tailor the fabric for a premium impression. Fabric can work in harmony or be used as a design element to move your eye throughout the interior,” Widrick said. Bring me the sheep At least one OEM understands the brief. “Take Volvo’s wool, which not only looks incredible—it feels truly incredible to sit in a seat engulfed in it. That’s a sustainable, inviting, and remarkably premium alternative to common leather that I wish more automakers would explore,” AutoPacific’s DeGraff said. “At Volvo Cars, we believe that good design, quality, and sustainability are inherently connected. Recycled and renewable materials aren’t just an option for us, they’re essential to shape a better future,” said Rekha Meena, head of colors, materials, and finishes at Volvo Cars. “Our responsibility is to blend these elements seamlessly, creating a sense of luxury and timelessness, all while ensuring that our products stand the test of time.” Like Widrick at Cadillac, Meena wants Volvo interiors to have a sense of harmony, and that’s on good display with the EX90. “When it comes to textiles, we see the versatility and strong potential to deliver all these qualities combining warmth, tactility, and refined expression in a way that enhances both the driving experience and the emotional connection to the interior,” Meena said. Volvo has a wool blend for the EX90. Credit: James Lipman/Volvo Cars Volvo has a wool blend for the EX90. Credit: James Lipman/Volvo Cars Textiles have a long tradition in Scandinavian design, where “luxury is about simplicity, honesty, and attention to detail,” Meena told Ars. “When developed with care, textile upholstery can feel refined, modern, and long-lasting. Textiles allow us to create softness and depth in ways other materials cannot, resulting in interiors that feel calm, thoughtful, and welcoming.” As for when to break away from leather, that’s up to the experience the design team wants to create for drivers. “We do not view textiles as replacements for leather or vinyl,” Meena said. “Each material has its own strengths, and customer choice remains paramount. What textiles offer, however, is something distinct: greater variation, a richer sensory experience, and a more human, approachable character.” That sense of harmony is achieved with the tailored wool blend option for Volvo’s EX90, and all four of the trim options for the affordable EX30 feature some degree of textile trim on the seats and door panels. Indeed, Volvo’s distinctive and somewhat left-field style is now as much part of the brand as its stated commitment to road safety. That’s all to say that I think it’s time for more luxury brands to get bold with their materials. A sofa or lounge chair doesn’t need animal hide to be considered stylish or luxurious, and neither does a car interior. It just needs good design. Jonathan M. Gitlin Automotive Editor Jonathan M.

Impressive in-software customization options. On par with Hall effect switches. 8,000-Hz polling rate. Simple robust build. Indicator screen is useful and entertaining.TIREDMediocre typing experience. Plastic bottom case. Some RGB troubles. Strange software decisions. Proprietary switches.A keyboard is more than the sum of its parts. To have a truly great typing experience, a lot has to come together—each aspect of a keyboard needs to be designed (or selected) with the rest of it in mind. But not every keyboard needs to strive for a great typing experience. Sometimes, they just need to get the job done. Take, for example, the Razer Huntsman V3 Pro.Nearly every decision on this keyboard is made with performance in mind, with both the sonic and tactile experience taking a backseat. Instead of the plush luxurious typing feel of a gasket-mounted keyboard with hand-lubed tactile switches and premium case materials, we have a plastic-and-metal lump fitted with ultrafast optical switches, capable of sending inputs 8,000 times every second to your PC, without a single extraneous feature to fatten it up (aside from the expected RGB lighting).I didn’t love typing on this keyboard, and I didn’t find myself itching to get it back on my desk when I took a break. But I have to admit, I quite like the tunnel-vision, gaming-only approach Razer takes. It's not for everyone, and it certainly isn’t for me.Speed Is KeyPhotograph: Henri RobbinsThe Razer Analog Optical Switches Gen-2 work fantastically. They’re responsive, easy to type on, and snap back quickly after being pressed. They have a bit of wobble, but don’t have any scratchiness or resistance—each key press feels smooth and controlled, even when pressed from the edge of the key.Razer Huntsman V3 Pro 8KHzRating: 7/10$250 $225 at Amazon$250 at Walmart$250 at Razer$250 at Best BuyUnlike gasket-mount keyboards, the Huntsman doesn’t exactly feel comfortable to type on. It’s stiff and simple, using a tray mount with a metal plate integrated into the top half of the case. The switches have a hard bottom out, without any bounce or flex when typing. Technically, the lack of flexibility is a performance benefit with ultraprecise switches in a gaming context. I’ve used some gasket-mount keyboards where a full key press would cause the internal assembly to move a not-insignificant distance, which could theoretically throw off a particularly precise input.At 8,000 hertz with hardly any input lag, key presses are almost instantaneous. A key’s actuation point can be raised high enough that even grazing the key with your finger will register an input. This can cause some issues, especially on the space bar when playing games that require precise double jumping (like Destiny 2), but once the settings are dialed in correctly, the keyboard feels incredibly intuitive and natural.Quite a few of the switches had issues with sound. Pinging is widespread across the keys and is exacerbated by the design of the tray-mount case, which sometimes picks up resonance when typing. The stabilizers are only lightly lubed from the factory, with longer keys feeling scratchier than others, with more resistance. While the stabilizer wires don’t rattle when typing, they do have a dry, plasticky sound when typing that’s different from standard keys.Strange SoftwarePhotograph: Henri RobbinsWhile I normally quite like Razer's Synapse software, I ran into quite a few hiccups with this keyboard. Nearly every key can be adjusted and customized, but two of them are stuck with their default settings no matter what. Both the Function key and the Windows key cannot be remapped with custom layouts, nor can their actuation distance be adjusted, meaning they’re both stuck with the default 1.2-mm actuation distance, even when other keys’ actuation distances can be adjusted freely. The only available option is disabling this key using “Gaming Mode” (Fn + Win).Razer Huntsman V3 Pro 8KHzRating: 7/10$250 $225 at Amazon$250 at Walmart$250 at Razer$250 at Best BuyThe screen on the right side is convenient and practical. I appreciate the gimmick of the actuation visualizer, which is a small line of dots that illuminates from left to right as you push down a key. It can help with determining and setting an ideal actuation distance, but beyond that, it’s almost entirely aesthetic. The rest of the indicators on the keyboard are nice, but they are underwhelming compared to the full OLED screens that many gaming keyboards have today.The rarely used cluster of keys above the arrow keys now has a secondary purpose, where each of them can be used with the Function layer to select one of five preset profiles. Four of them are customizable, but the first, called “Factory Default,” seemingly functions as a fail-safe in case you royally mess up another profile map (such as remapping your space bar to your controller’s “A” button—something the software actually warns you against if you attempt it).Across these profiles, you can make all of the standard Hall effect adjustments. Each key’s individual actuation distance can be adjusted, Rapid Trigger allows you to customize the key’s reset point (so you can immediately press the key down again instead of waiting for it to return past the initial actuation point), and Razer’s SOCD (Simultaneous Opposing Cardinal Direction) setting, called Snap Tap, works like any other, letting one key override another for rapid strafing.Photograph: Henri RobbinsSynapse also allows for more minute customizations, with adjustments to switch dead zones, rapid trigger sensitivity, and “Continuous Rapid Trigger,” which keeps Rapid Trigger active above the default actuation point until a key is fully released.During my time with this keyboard, I struggled quite a bit with the RGB lighting. It would regularly stop functioning at all during use, requiring me to unplug the keyboard to reset something internally. At one point, the main RGB layer stopped illuminating entirely, with only the OLED display and the illuminated Function layer (displaying which keys have functionality when Fn is pressed) maintaining their lighting. The strangest part was that the RGB lighting would return to the default setting when my computer was locked, indicating some kind of issue with the Synapse software. Ultimately, after troubleshooting quite a bit, I had to completely uninstall and reinstall both Synapse and Chroma for it to work again.Razer Huntsman V3 Pro 8KHzRating: 7/10$250 $225 at Amazon$250 at Walmart$250 at Razer$250 at Best BuyKeys on the keyboard can be remapped to game pad controls, using the analog input to replicate the variable inputs of triggers and joysticks. This works exceptionally well, even allowing for customizable input curves to fine-tune movements. I tested this primarily with racing games and didn’t run into any issues with input accuracy or response speed (however, controlling a car with a keyboard is still jarring when compared to a standard controller). The only issue with this system is that, for some reason, each button on the controller can only be mapped to one key at a time. This isn’t a huge issue, but it does seem like an unnecessary limitation.Not Pointlessly PremiumPhotograph: Henri RobbinsThe case is nothing fancy. Metal on top and plastic on the underside. Just enough metal to prevent any flex when typing and not a bit more. If you try to twist the keyboard chassis, it gives without much struggle, and for some reason, a couple of the switches even register a single millimeter of key press (which is clearly indicated on the side display).Taking apart the keyboard, there’s not too much inside. The two halves of the keyboard are held together by a handful of screws under the keycaps, and they snap together using plastic clips around the edges of the case. Once open, you’ll see two Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) attached to the top case: One housing the switches, and another containing the knob and buttons in the top right of the keyboard. On the bottom case, a ribbon cable connects the main PCB to a separate daughterboard containing the USB-C port. Between these are two sheets of foam: One thick piece that sits between each switch, and a thin one that isolates the two halves from one another.This internal assembly is simple and creates a typing experience that is consistent and rigid. Plastic supports prop up the top half of the case to prevent any flex when typing, and the foam limits extraneous noise. There are longevity issues, since the plastic clips risk snapping every time you disassemble the keyboard, and the screws are all being driven directly into plastic that can break down over time, but there is nothing that I think will cause issues if you leave this keyboard in one piece.Razer Huntsman V3 Pro 8KHzRating: 7/10$250 $225 at Amazon$250 at Walmart$250 at Razer$250 at Best BuyAs great as the optical switches are, they are entirely proprietary. This means you can’t swap them out with standard Cherry MX-style switches. The switch mechanism itself can easily be replaced with another Razer optical switch, since they snap in place with two tabs on the underside of the plate. The sensor is two small components soldered onto the PCB that would be pretty difficult to replace, but as it's rated for over 100 million actuations, failure isn’t a serious concern.Photograph: Henri RobbinsUnlike quite a few other keyboards from both Razer and other companies, which use memory foam, the wrist rest included with the Huntsman V3 Pro is entirely made of rigid plastic (with a faux leather wrap on the top surface). This makes it much more solid, without any cushioning for your wrists. This could be an upgrade or a downgrade compared to a more plush wrist rest. The material on top is comfortable, and the wrist rest is magnetized, allowing it to attach to the keyboard and not move during regular use. It’s good despite the lack of cushioning.Initially, I didn’t like this keyboard very much. Coming from my own world of custom-built keyboards with subpar specs and superb typing experiences, it was jarring. It didn’t feel great to type on, and the performance benefits of it weren’t obvious in regular day-to-day use. When editing documents or replaying Halo 3 for the 20th time, you won’t feel the benefits of 8,000 hertz or Snap Tap strafing. But once I took it into multiplayer lobbies, I was able to look past the features I initially thought were missing and experience this keyboard properly.The price feels high for something with this build quality and typing experience, but for its level of performance and accuracy, it feels a bit more reasonable. I can’t say this keyboard is perfect—there are countless things I would change to make it feel better to use—but there really aren’t any performance improvements I would make. If that’s what you really care about, if you want something with no extra frills that you can fine-tune to your preferences, this might be the right keyboard for you.Razer Huntsman V3 Pro 8KHzRating: 7/10$250 $225 at Amazon$250 at Walmart$250 at Razer$250 at Best Buy$250 $225 at Amazon$250 at Walmart$250 at Razer$250 at Best Buy"

    "summary": "Toyota has unveiled the 2027 Highlander, the first fully electric version of the vehicle and the automaker’s fourth EV in the US. It’s also the company’s first EV assembled in the country and the first electric model with three rows of seats. The automaker already sells the electric C-HR crossover and the electric bZ SUV in the US. While the 2027 Highlander resembles its predecessors, its lines look sharper and it has broader fenders. In addition, it features flush door handles similar to Tesla’s, which were designed for aerodynamics but which China recently banned out of safety concerns. \nThe new Highlander will be available in several varieties, specifically in Limited and XLE (Executive Luxury Edition) grades with either front-wheel or all-wheel drive configuration. If you get the Limited edition all-wheel drive with a 95.8 kWh battery, you can get a range of 320 miles on a single charge, based on Toyota’s estimates. Take note that range estimates by manufacturers and the EPA could be different from each other. It would be more accurate to compare EPA ranges between vehicles across brands, because they were determined using the agency’s testing methodologies. \nThe 2027 Highlander in XLE front wheel drive configuration with a 77 kWh battery has a manufacturer-estimated range of 287 miles. Meanwhile, the all-wheel drive XLE variant comes with either a 77 kWh battery that can power it for 270 miles or a 95.8 kWh battery that has an estimated range of 320 miles, similar to the Limited edition vehicle. The all-wheel drive variants have a total maximum power output of 338 horsepower, whereas the front-wheel models have a power output of 221 hp. \nAll the EV’s versions can seat seven, with the third row being able to fold flat if you need it for cargo. They come with heated front seats, but you can also get ventilated and heated second row seats for an additional fee. Toyota will start selling the 2027 Highlander in late 2026, with some regions getting it early next year. The automaker says it will announce pricing for the EV model closer to its release date. \nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/the-2027-toyota-highlander-is-fully-electric-and-has-a-320-mile-range-115828463.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "With his newfound focus on the Moon, Elon musk is making some wild new plans. In an xAI meeting with employees, Musk said the company needed to build an AI satellite factory on the moon with a gigantic catapult to launch them into space, according to audio heard by The New York Times. \nAll of that would be part of the billionaire's plans to create a massive orbiting AI \"data center\" that uses satellites powered by the sun and kept cool by the vacuum of space (a bad plan, some experts say). Any satellites launched from the Moon would presumably orbit the Moon as well, though Musk didn't provide any additional details. \n\n\"You have to go to the moon\" in order to build the required AI capabilities, Musk told employees. \"It’s difficult to imagine what an intelligence of that scale would think about, but it’s going to be incredibly exciting to see it happen.\" \nSuch a catapult would certainly need to be powerful — though the Moon has only one-sixth the gravity of Earth, the minimum escape velocity required for orbit is still around 3,800 MPH or five times the speed of sound. That's currently possible with electromagnetic railguns that launch projectiles at speeds up to Mach 8.8, though any satellite launched by such a device would need to withstand acceleration forces around 10,000 g or more. \nIt's fun to think about it, but there are a few tiny steps required first. That starts with orbiting the Moon and eventually landing on the surface. Then you'd need to build a colony, followed by a factory, all of which would require a large number of manned and unmanned expeditions. As a reminder, we haven't been to the moon for over 50 years and none of the colony or factory stuff has ever been done.  \nEarly last year Musk said in a post on X that SpaceX would be going \"straight to Mars\" and that \"the Moon is a distraction.\" However, the CEO apparently shifted his near-term priorities to building a \"self-growing city on the Moon\" because it's a more achievable target. In a post on X, Musk said the company could complete this in less than 10 years, while doing the same on Mars would take over 20 years.\nAny estimates from Musk himself certainly need to be treated skeptically, though. Elon once said in 2017 that SpaceX would send cargo missions to Mars by 2022 aboard a rocket that's still being tested in 2026.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/science/space/elon-musks-latest-scheme-is-a-satellite-catapult-on-the-moon-113403143.html?src=rss",

Close Adam Breeden/ZDNETVirtual private networks (VPNs) are crucial tools for protecting your online security and privacy. At their core, VPNs are networks that encrypt your traffic, masking your IP address and adding an extra layer of security that keeps your communication private. This can stop marketers from tracking and creating profiles on you, from collecting and sharing your data, and can also help you circumvent location-based blocks. A reliable VPN can also grant you access to streaming content libraries outside your region. This is perfect when you are away from home and don't want to miss your favorite show. As a bonus, when you subscribe, you can often take advantage of additional privacy features, such as ad blockers, Dark Web breach alerts, data breach scanners, and password managers.

What is the best VPN service right now?My pick for the best VPN in 2026 is NordVPN. NordVPN offers the full package -- fast speeds, stable connections, an expansive server network, and excellent streaming capabilities. It's also easy to use with a variety of apps for your Windows, Mac, and mobile devices. Plans start at $2.69 per month.My second choice is ExpressVPN This secure VPN offers some of the best and most consistent speeds across its global servers while still being user-friendly. Expect to pay $2.44 per month on a two-year plan, and you also receive four months of free service on signup.Also: The best smart TV VPNs of 2025: Securely stream your favorite shows worldwide with the best VPNs on the marketThe ZDNET team has decades of experience in the VPN arena, and I've tested all the VPN services on this list. I rigorously evaluate them through frequent real-world speed tests and rank them based on the number of servers, security features, price, usability, and other factors important to you. If you're interested in signing up for a VPN, pick a trustworthy service that doesn't drastically impact your speed or internet connection. You should also consider the size and variety of its server network, whether or not it's right for streaming, and how the VPN provider treats user data. There appears to be a price war underway, and some subscriptions are the lowest I've seen since Black Friday last year. These are my top picks for 2026. Sort by All Countries and servers Usability Speed and performance Security Price The best VPNs of 2026 Show less View now at NordVPN NordVPN is one of the most widely used VPNs, and for most users it ticks all the boxes. This makes it my top pick overall in 2026. Why we like it: NordVPN is secure, fast, suitable for streaming, and has all the features you'll likely need. I've found it to be one of the fastest VPNs with the most consistent speed measurements and rapid initial server connectivity. While it's worth noting that rival ExpressVPN is often faster in some cases, averaging out at higher speeds with long-distance servers, NordVPN tends to perform better when you use smart, local servers. NordVPN is fine for basic use but offers many features beyond a mere VPN tunnel, including peer-to-peer (P2P) sharing support and an optional second layer of encryption through Double VPN. This allows you to set up a dedicated IP address to run a VPN that also acts as a server. In my tests with Netflix, NordVPN emerged as a top VPN for streaming content with a high success rate in accessing geo-blocked content. When set up with the Privacy Hero 2 router, it also did exceptionally well in accessing streaming services worldwide. Last year, the company launched NordWhisper, a new protocol that allows users to connect to VPN servers from networks that typically limit traditional VPN traffic and enforce restrictive network policies. In a recent service update, its macOS and Windows apps have also been refreshed. Sadly, the interactive map is now gone, but it is a much cleaner interface than before, making it easier for users to navigate.NordVPN's kill switch activates if your connection suddenly drops, protecting your connection and data. There's also a handy pause function if you need to access a local website or service and revert to your original IP address. In its fifth independent audit, NordVPN says its no-logs policy has been verified. There's also good news for fans of NordVPN's secure device network service Meshnet. The company listened to user feedback and reversed its decision to close it down at the end of 2025.Review: NordVPN: Consistent speed and performanceWho it's for: Those who want the best overall VPN around. It's a solid, fast VPN to use across different devices, and for a relatively affordable price. NordVPN is compatible with all major platforms and provides a server network of 126 countries. It also allows you to connect 10 devices simultaneously under one account and is excellent for streaming.Who should look elsewhere: NordVPN will suit most users' needs, but if you want speed first in faraway servers, ExpressVPN is the right alternative.You can pick between three types of plans with two-year, one-year, or one-month contract terms. Your choice depends on whether you want advanced features such as a password manager, data breach scanner, cloud storage, or file encryption.Prices start at $2.69 per month on a two-year plan or $4.29 per month for a one-year subscription. Alternatively, you can try NordVPN for a month and take advantage of its 30-day money-back guarantee.

Who it's for: Individuals who see speed as king. This VPN has consistently ranked first in my speed tests over the past few years, on both standard broadband and fiber.ExpressVPN is also the developer of Aircove, a router product line with ExpressVPN built in. This saves you the legwork if you want blanket coverage for all your home devices. Alternatively, you can manually set up ExpressVPN to work with gaming consoles and TVs that do not natively support VPN apps, but you may need to install the VPN directly on your router.ExpressVPN recently switched to a system -- a move I applaud, as it gives VPN customers the range of choice they now expect -- and this makes it more affordable. The best deal is the basic plan, which is $2.44 per month on a two-year contract, with four months of free access thrown in. The provider also offers Advanced and Pro subscriptions, available for $3.14 per month and $5.24 per month, respectively, on a two-year term. These more expensive tiers include ExpressVPN's ad-blocker, 12 to 14 simultaneous connections rather than 10, ExpressKeys, and ExpressMailGuard. There is a 30-day money-back guarantee. While customer service is friendly and polite, they persist in customer retention, so you'll need to set aside some time if you wish to cancel after the 30-day period. Who should look elsewhere: VPN customers who want the most budget-friendly option should consider Surfshark or another of my recommended, cheaper VPNs.

These more expensive tiers include ExpressVPN's ad-blocker, 12 to 14 simultaneous connections rather than 10, ExpressKeys, and ExpressMailGuard. There is a 30-day money-back guarantee. While customer service is friendly and polite, they persist in customer retention, so you'll need to set aside some time if you wish to cancel after the 30-day period.

I ran a series of speed and connectivity tests in February 2026 on each VPN's paid service to see how they compare.I performed the tests using a fiber connection in the U.K., with an average starting speed, without a VPN, of 776.47 Mbps download and 108.11 Mbps upload. Each smart location and U.S. connection test was repeated three times, and I then calculated the average. On rare occasions, I encountered an extreme outlier, such as horrendous speeds on a specific server outside the norm. In these instances, I repeated the test, as servers may sometimes be experiencing errors or undergoing maintenance. I also tested for the presence of domain name service (DNS) leaks.Previously, I performed repeated tests using a broadband connection in the U.K. with an average starting speed, without a VPN, of between 50 and 60 Mbps download and around 15 to 20 Mbps upload. This gave me a strong indicator of which VPNs tend to work best with slower initial broadband speeds, an important factor as not everyone has access to high-speed broadband services.Please remember that results may differ for you and vary from country to country, so the below should be considered a snapshot. Your internet service provider (ISP) and broadband subscription may also impact your speeds. The results below are not the exact speeds you should expect. You can instead use these results to get a general idea of how your speeds could change with a VPN. Remember that the further away the VPN server, the more your speed may be impacted. Speeds will typically be quicker when you connect to a local server, compared to selecting Australia, for example, unless you're in the country. Show more Which is the right VPN for you? Choose this top VPN service...If you want...NordVPNThe best VPN overall.

Private Internet Access is a great choice if you want a set-and-forget, affordable VPN, but the interface won't suit everyone, as it is rather dated. Still, this VPN will support and protect as many devices as you like under one account, including your PC, smartphone, and even your smart TV. Show more Factors to consider when choosing a VPN service These are the most important factors to consider when deciding to try a VPN or switching from your existing VPN service to another provider.Speed: Every VPN operates differently, and every user experience varies. Your ISP will offer speeds that are not the same as those of someone in another location. When you are testing a new VPN, keep your base speed in mind, and look out for VPN solutions with minimal speed loss -- especially if you are stuck on slow ISP services.Apps: VPN providers should offer compatibility for multiple platforms and operating systems. Take a look at the user interfaces, features, and compatibility offered by your chosen VPN provider before you commit.Simultaneous connections: If you're paying for a VPN, you might want to use it across multiple devices, such as a desktop PC, smartphone, or smart TV. We recommend you sign up for a plan supporting at least six devices, and thankfully, most paid plans now offer at least that many.Trial periods: Before committing to a VPN provider, test them out, that's what money-back guarantees are for. Remember that most VPN providers will give you 30 days to cancel and secure a refund. Some even offer up to 45 days.Free VPN providers: Running VPN infrastructure is expensive. If the VPN provider doesn't make money from your service fees, they're going to make money from you somehow -- sometimes even by selling your personal information. Stick with the trusted commercial vendors we've tested or the handful of free plans we recommend. There are also cases where \"free\" VPNs undermine what the software is designed for: data protection and security. Contract terms: VPN providers constantly offer discounts, typically on longer-term plans. Consider the fine print before you sign up. Remember to cancel before automatic renewal if you're no longer happy with the service or want to switch to a cheaper deal elsewhere. Use cases: Your VPN selection should relate to how you want to use a VPN. For example, you may want one specifically for streaming geo-locked content, or you may need a VPN that is likely to work in restricted countries. Consider these points before making your final choice, and test them out during your money-back guarantee period to ensure the VPN is right for you.Advanced features: You might like the idea of bundling your new VPN with antivirus software, a data breach alert tool, or a password manager. Check out the advanced features offered under different plans to make the right choice. Show more How to use a VPN Charlie Osborne | ZDNETIn order to use a VPN, the setup will depend on the VPN provider, your contract, and the devices you want to protect. You will first need to subscribe to a VPN service and download the VPN software to your machine. You can visit the VPN service's official website, or you may receive a download link through email. Alternatively, visit Google Play or the App Store for mobile app options. Open the software, grant any required permissions for the VPN, and sign in with your credentials. ZDNET | Charlie OsborneChoose a server location and connect to the VPN. In this example, you can select ExpressVPN's \"...\" button to select a server from its list of countries. Most VPNs will give you a \"smart\" or \"intelligent\" location set as default, typically in your country, which will often give you local content and the best speeds, considering these servers are closest to you. Also: Best VPNs for Smart TVsIt's that simple! Of course, you can check out your VPN's settings and tailor your experience to your liking. However, for many users, sticking to default options and having a few favorite servers will be enough.How I test VPNs I tested and analyzed the best VPNs in 2026 using the following criteria to help you make an informed decision:Performance: My top VPNs must meet a minimum performance standard. After all, there's no point in using a VPN while streaming if your connection keeps dropping or lagging. I frequently conduct speed tests to stay up to date and informed of any service changes. I have extensively tested these VPNs with low broadband and high fiber initial speeds over the course of many years. Simultaneous connections: Many VPNs limit the number of devices you can connect to a service simultaneously. If you have a phone, tablet, laptop, desktop, and possibly even a smart TV, and want to connect to a VPN, you need a service that allows at least six simultaneous connections, although I prefer unlimited simultaneous connections.Security: A VPN's security protocols and encryption levels must stay up to scratch. I want the development team for VPNs I recommend to prioritize security improvements over time and promptly address reported bugs, and I look for evidence of transparency around security updates.Kill switch: A kill switch prevents you from using an unprotected connection. This is an important feature for a VPN, as it protects you by preventing a return to a default Wi-Fi connection should your internet connection unexpectedly drop. All of my recommended VPNs provide this feature.Geo-blocks and streaming: VPNs can be key to accessing local content and services while you're away from home. I ensured that our top recommendations perform well, given these factors, and are unlikely to slow down your connection while you are streaming. Platforms: What systems and devices can you run the VPN on? My VPN recommendations have to offer easy-to-use and intuitive desktop software for at least Windows and macOS, alongside mobile apps.Countries and servers: In how many different countries does the VPN have servers? This can include physical and virtual servers, and whether there are enough -- at least 50 or so -- to provide variety.Trial length and price: Each VPN I recommend has a solid money-back guarantee of at least 30 days, and many will offer mobile users a seven-day trial.Support: As with any subscription software, you may encounter problems installing apps, using the service, renewing, or canceling. I list VPNs with a support team available, although the communication channels on offer may vary.For a more extensive breakdown, check out ZDNET's comprehensive VPN testing methodology page.

Recent tariff changes have not directly impacted virtual private network software. Software is rarely considered in tariff alterations, and so subscription services should be safe, for now. However, this doesn't mean the industry as a whole will not be impacted, as associated hardware -- such as servers, RAM, and networking equipment -- could be subject to higher costs, and this may be passed on to consumers. Show more VPN FAQs What is a VPN? VPN, short for virtual private network, lets you browse the internet privately and connect securely to open or public Wi-Fi networks. A VPN allows you to change your virtual location by redirecting the connection through one of its servers worldwide. A VPN also encrypts your traffic, hiding you from hackers, internet service providers, and governments.If your online activities are being monitored at the ISP level, they may recognize the signature of a VPN, even if exactly what you are doing is masked.VPNs are useful in unblocking geo-restricted content and can be vital tools for accessing information in countries with repressive governments. They are also important services for anyone who wants to maintain a high level of safety and privacy online, and due to recent law changes, they may also allow you to bypass online age verification checks. Show more How can I tell if my VPN is working or not? A fully functional VPN should protect your privacy and mask your location and IP address. If you're unsure if your VPN is working correctly, there are tools that make checking your service's performance easy.You can find out your IP address and location by using whatismyipaddress.com. Compare the IP address and location when you're connected with and without a VPN. If they are different, then your VPN is doing its job.It's possible that your VPN is leaking your data and potentially exposing your online activity. You can run tests on a site like DNS Leak Test to ensure your VPN has no issues with domain name service (DNS) leaks or IP leaks. Show more Do I need a VPN if I'm traveling or using a Wi-Fi hotspot? If you're traveling or using the internet in a public place like a coffee shop, data encryption is critical. Most public Wi-Fi hotspots are open and unencrypted, and this means anyone on the network can see what you send and may be able to eavesdrop on your activities or potentially steal your information. You should avoid public Wi-Fi hotspots when possible and instead use cellular as you never know what threats are lurking on them. Show more Do I need a VPN for my smart TV? It probably isn't worth it to invest in a VPN purely for use with your TV. You'll find that only some TV operating systems natively support VPN apps, whereas others -- such as Tizen -- do not, which means you will have to find a workaround, such as installing a VPN on your router or Amazon TV Firestick (outside of those operating the Vega OS, of which only a small selection of VPN apps are available).That said, if you want to use a VPN to access different streaming service libraries, a VPN provides the means to do so. This is a legally gray area, and you may only be able to access universally licensed content if VPN use is detected.

I've highlighted paid services in this article, although some offer a free tier or a money-back guarantee during a trial period. In general, I don't recommend most entirely free VPN services because they may not be secure.Operating a good VPN service requires hundreds of servers worldwide and vast networking resources. If you're not paying to support that infrastructure, who is? Probably advertisers or data miners. If you use a free service, your data will probably be sold. You wouldn't want your data to go to some company to sift through; it completely defeats the purpose of a VPN.Before you choose a VPN service, free or paid, know that no single tool can guarantee your privacy. Anything can be compromised. A VPN protects your data from your computer to the VPN service. It doesn't protect what you put on servers. It doesn't protect your data from the VPN provider's VPN servers to whatever site or cloud-based application you use. Privacy and security require you to be diligent throughout your digital journey, and VPNs, while helpful, are not a miracle cure.That said, if you would like to explore free options, I have compiled a guide of the best free VPNs available.

Yes, in most countries, including the U.S., the U.K., and the majority of Europe. In some countries, VPNs are illegal, or severely discouraged and limited to state-approved software.At the moment, countries including North Korea, Iraq, and Belarus have reportedly banned the use of VPNs entirely. As noted in NordVPN's country guide, others -- like China, Russia, and Egypt -- discourage VPN use and try to stop new adoption by demonizing VPNs as software widely used for criminal activity, or they may only allow state-controlled VPNs to operate. Show more Should I leave a VPN on all of the time? We recommend that you do because a VPN provides a blanket layer of protection for your online activities. If speed loss is problematic during some activities like gaming, at least use one during sensitive activities like accessing financial accounts. You should also always use a VPN when connecting to public Wi-Fi hotspots. Show more What is a VPN kill switch? Let's say you're surfing online, and your VPN connection suddenly fails. Your phone or computer will likely immediately try to reconnect and do so directly without going through a VPN. All of a sudden, your data is unprotected.A kill switch is a feature in your device's VPN app that detects when a connection fails and immediately shuts down network access. It's not a 100% perfect solution, but we wouldn't recommend using a VPN that doesn't offer a kill switch. Show more What are simultaneous connections, and why should I care? When you have multiple devices -- such as a tablet, a laptop, a TV, and a smartphone -- and you are using these devices for different tasks, you still want to keep your data and connections secure on each machine.When you have enabled the VPN on more than one device at the same time, you are using simultaneous connections. It's always best to have this feature in a VPN to ensure your privacy isn't accidentally compromised through one device or another. Show more Does a VPN slow down your connection? Using a VPN can often slow down your connection because your data is encrypted, decrypted, and sent through intermediate servers. Game responsiveness might suffer, for example, or you may notice your streaming service doesn't load as fast as usual.However, much depends on the quality of your initial connection. For example, you might encounter buffering issues on a low-speed broadband connection, but you wouldn't notice any change when you are using fiber -- even with the same VPN.With many high-quality VPNs now available, however, the negative impact is often unnoticeable, unless there is a problem with the VPN server you connect to. To fix this, try a server in a different location and see if that improves your connection. Show more How much does a VPN cost? A VPN's cost can vary depending on your needs. Basic plans often cost a few dollars per month, but pricing structures are often displayed as monthly equivalents, so you may have to pay upfront for the full contract at sign-up. Tax may also be added. If you need a specialized VPN, such as one able to circumvent blocks in countries like China, expect to pay more. Overall, expect to pay between $2 - $10 per month, or less if you sign up during sales events such as Black Friday week. Show more Why are month-to-month VPN plans so expensive? In my opinion, VPN providers usually set extortionate pricing on one-month subscriptions to deter customers from opting for these plans. While most VPNs are available month-to-month, they are usually priced at over $10 per month and aren't great value compared to one-year and two-year plans. The exception is Mullvad, which operates on a set monthly price of €5, no matter how long you want the VPN for. We recommend that you choose a VPN for a longer term, as you will pay less. You can use a VPN's 30-day money-back guarantee to see if the VPN suits you, or cancel before this period ends to receive a full refund. Show more Will my VPN increase in price? VPN providers often join in during sales events and offer holiday promotions, reducing the price of a subscription by a few dollars or more. The price will often jump after your promotional period ends, whether this is for an annual plan or a two-year contract. Remember to watch when your subscription ends to avoid costly renewal payments. It might be better to turn off auto-renewal and then sign back up. Show more Do I pay for a VPN monthly or yearly? Typically, VPN providers model their pricing on a monthly basis, but you may have to pay for your contract upfront when you make your purchase. For example, a VPN available for $2 per month will likely equate to $24 upfront on a yearly contract, plus tax. One of the only exceptions in the market at the moment is Mullvad, which offers a month-by-month price. You enjoy the best discounts when signing up for longer terms. Two years is usually the longest term you can sign up for, although some VPN providers offer five-year subscriptions. Show more What VPNs should I avoid? You should avoid VPNs without a long-term customer base or strong customer feedback. Shady VPNs may offer you free services, but they may store or sell your information in return. You should also avoid VPN providers with known security problems and a lack of transparency around resolving them.

    "summary": "Smart plugs aren’t the most complicated smart home device — they really just turn stuff off and on — but they do make life a little easier. Since using smart plugs, I’ve grown accustomed to having the living room lamps click on just before sunset and go off when I say goodnight to Alexa or the Google Assistant/Gemini (Siri can turn off a few of my lights, but isn’t compatible with all of them). Most smart home device makers have a plug or two in their lineups, but finding one that’s compatible with your chosen ecosystem, that’s easy to set up and reliably connects can involve a little trial and error. That’s why we tried more than a dozen models to find the best smart plugs you can buy right now..\n \nBest smart plugs for 2026\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \n\n \n \nThe best outdoor smart plugs for 2026\n \nMost people will likely use outdoor plugs for two things: patio lighting and holiday string lights. The devices are designed for the outdoors with a weatherproof protection rating of IP64 or higher, which means they’re impervious to dust and can handle splashing water from rain and sprinklers. They have a longer Wi-Fi range than indoor plugs, for obvious reasons, and many have dual outlets, with individual control over each one.\n \nSetup is the same as for indoor plugs: you’ll use your phone to help the plug find your Wi-Fi using its companion app. The only tricky part is getting your phone within Bluetooth range of the plug (which it uses to initialize setup) and in Wi-Fi range at the same time. I had to awkwardly stand at a triangulated point in the middle of my driveway to get things communicating properly. Once set up, the plugs will communicate using your router for voice and app control and your phone needn’t be anywhere near the plug.\n \n\n \n \nBest uses for a smart plug\n \nBefore you buy one, it helps to know how a smart plug works best. They are designed for things that have an on/off switch, making them great for doing things like turning regular ol’ lamps into smart lights. If you want a fan to move some air around before you get home, a smart plug can help. You can load a basic coffee maker with grounds and water the night before and wake up to a fresh pot in the morning. And instead of an air purifier running all day, you could set it to just run when you’re away.\n \nBut gadgets that need to be programmed further, or require a stand-by mode, aren't ideal. If you want to control built-in lights, you’ll need a smart light switch, which are more involved than smart plugs as they can involve in-wall installation. Smart bulbs are also an option for automation, and we have an entire guide devoted to those.\n \nSome smart plugs can even monitor how much energy they use and display those figures within their companion app. That might not be much use on its own, as lamps with LED light bulbs consume very little energy, but it could help you keep tabs on your overall energy consumption.\n \nWhat to consider when buying a smart plug\n \nSetup and use\n \nAdding a smart plug to your home is relatively simple. You’ll use the manufacturer’s app to initially connect, after which you can add the plug to a compatible smart home ecosystem so you can use voice control and other features. Both the brand’s app and your smart home app will let you name the plug, set schedules and program “routines” which provide automation for multiple smart devices at once. But as you can guess, a manufacturer’s app only lets you control products from that brand. If you want whole-home automation, operating, say, a plug from TP-Link’s Kasa, a smart bulb from Philips Hue, a smart thermostat from Honeywell and a camera from Arlo without switching apps, you’ll need to use a smart home platform, which means you’ll need to consider compatibility.\n \nCompatibility\n \nSmart home devices connect through wireless protocols, often using more than one to communicate with your phone, smart speaker, router and in some cases, one another. The majority of smart plugs use Wi-Fi, but some have recently incorporated Matter, a relatively new wireless standard intended to solve integration issues between different brands and manufacturers, while also improving security and reliability.\n \nMore of these smart plugs are coming to market and, for now, most Matter devices work via Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and a low-power mesh network called Thread. Matter requires a controller that stays at home, like a hub or smart speaker, to manage things when you’re out and about.\n \nAs for Bluetooth, most plugs, including all Matter plugs, use the short-range protocol to get the device set up for the first time. Some can continue to run on Bluetooth in the absence of another option, but the connection isn’t as reliable and you won’t be able to control the plug when you’re away from home, or perhaps even just on the other side of the apartment.\n \nBecause Matter is relatively new, it may be easier to consider the manufacturer’s system you’d use the most. There are four major “branded” smart home platforms: Amazon’s Alexa, Google Home, Apple’s HomeKit and Samsung’s SmartThings. The first two work with the widest range of brands and are compatible with both iOS and Android devices. HomeKit not only limits app access to Apple devices, but it’s also compatible with fewer plugs. You can also turn to open-source software like Home Assistant or go with the larger functionality of IFTTT if you want to, say, have your lights turn off when your Uber arrives. For the purposes of our testing, we stuck with the four big players. Nearly every plug we looked at clearly stated which platforms it works with, both on the packaging and retail product pages.\n \nOf course, there’s no rule that says you have to stick with one home assistant. You might have an Echo Dot in the basement, a HomePod in the living room and a Google Nest Mini in the kitchen, each controlling any compatible devices. My kid has a great time telling Alexa to turn on a light then asking Google's Gemini to turn it back off.\n \n\n \n \n \n \nHubs and smart plugs\n \nAll of our top picks recommended here don’t require a hub and connect directly to your home’s Wi-Fi router. That means if you already have wireless internet and a smartphone or tablet, you can quite literally plug and play. The exception is Apple’s HomeKit. If you want to pair up a compatible plug with that platform, you’ll need a HomePod speaker, Apple TV or an iPad that stays in your home to enable remote control when you’re away.\n \nSome smart plugs require a hub regardless of which platform you use. For our guide, we focused on the simplicity (and lower cost) of options that work on their own, but hub-dependent devices may make sense in certain situations. Some companies, like Aqara and Lutron for example, make a vast range of smart home products, adding automatic shades, window sensors, smart locks and air quality monitors to the more traditional cameras and plugs. If you’re going all-in on one brand and plan to get a plethora of connected devices, a hub can keep your Wi-Fi network from getting too crowded and provide a more seamless setup with reliable connectivity. Zigbee devices use their own protocol (different from Wi-Fi or Bluetooth) and also requires a hub. \n \nSharing\n \nOnce a plug is set up with your platform and voice assistant of choice, anyone can control the plug just by talking. If someone else wants to control things with their phone, things get more complicated. Google makes it easiest, allowing you to invite another person just by tapping the + button within the Home app. Whomever you invite will have full access to your connected devices – including cameras – so this is only for people you trust the most.\n \nHomeKit makes it similarly easy to grant app access to someone else, but as with most things Apple, it only works for other iOS users. Amazon only allows you to share access to your Echo, not your connected home devices.\n \nMany smart plug manufacturers allow you to share control through their app by inviting another person via email. But this only grants access to devices of that brand. Hopefully as Matter expands, multi-admin features will become more widespread.\n \nIf you get a new Wi-Fi network\n \nMost people will wirelessly connect their smart plugs to their home’s Wi-Fi router. Matter, Z-Wave, Thread and other smart home protocols can work over local networks, but for most setups, the signals telling your plugs what to do will be dispatched through your router. If you happen to get a new one (like I did when it became clear my very basic gateway could not handle the number of smart home devices being tested) you’ll need to take a few steps to get everything reconnected.\n \nDepending on the brand, the steps may simply involve using the plug’s companion app to update your credentials (network name and password). Or it will require deleting the device in the companion app, doing a factory reset (typically by pressing the onboard button for 10 seconds) and setting up the plug like it's brand new. GE Sync and Emporia plugs allow for a credentials update via their apps, others, like TP-Link Kasa and Meross plugs require deletion and a factory reset to get along with your new network. Amazon’s smart plug updates automatically after updating the associated Echo device.\n \nHow we tested the best smart plugs\n \nBefore I decided which smart plugs to test, we considered brands Engadget staffers have had the best experiences with, both in review capacity and personally. We also checked out other online reviews. I then looked at factors like price, compatibility and relative popularity. Then, I tested about a dozen plugs using their companion apps and the four major smart home ecosystems. With lamps, lights, heaters, fans and more plugged into them, I set schedules, create routines, use voice control and generally live with the devices to evaluate them. I and continue to test good candidates as new models hit the market. \n \nOther smart plugs we tested\n \nEve Energy Strip\n \nThe Eve Energy Strip only works with HomeKit and it’s a bit more expensive than our pick for a smart strip. But it’s an exceedingly attractive device complete with an aluminum frame and easy-to-read LED buttons. Those act as both indicators and manual switches for each of the three, individually controlled and nicely spaced plugs. Setup happens through the HomeKit app but after that, you can control the plug (and curiously, many other smart home devices active in your HomeKit profile) through the Eve Energy app. Here, you’ll be able to create schedules and automations as well as monitor the plug’s energy usage.\n \nMeross Matter plug (MSS115)\n \nI wasn’t able to test the Meross Matter plug fully. It requires Wi-Fi splitting, a process that’s certainly possible for the average consumer, but more involved than it should be, considering the more than dozen other plugs I’ve tested don’t require such a step. The plug itself also blocked the other outlet. Meross has an updated version of the Matter device on the way, one that looks to solve both issues and we’ll update this guide accordingly once we’ve had a chance to test it.\n \nRoku Smart Plug\n \nRoku’s smart home gear is basically Wyze equipment with an app and packaging that are more purple. The Roku smart plug performed just fine with both compatible voice assistants (Alexa and Gemini). The companion app doesn’t offer scheduling that revolves around the timing of the sunset in your area, but the plugs go for less than $10 each and if you’ve got a Roku TV or streaming device set up and want to keep everything on-brand, it could be a fit.\n \nAquara Smart Plug\n \nThe Aqara plug requires an Aqara hub. In tests, the connectivity was solid and the companion app allowed for useful if/then automations that can rope in other Aqara devices like locks, window shades, cameras and more. The plug also worked well with voice assistants from Amazon, Google and Apple. As a stand-alone plug, however, it’s tough to recommend the nearly $100 combo to anyone who isn’t planning to get a complete Aqara smart home setup.\n \nSmart plug FAQs\n \nWhat are the disadvantages of a smart plug?\n \nWhile they’re great when everything is working properly, smart plugs can be frustrating, adding a layer of complication to the simple act of turning on a light, if something goes wrong. For example: If your Wi-Fi goes out, your smart plug won’t work. If the smart plug loses its connection to your router, it won’t work. If you change your Wi-Fi password or provider, you’ll have to re-program your smart plugs. If you forget what you named a particular plug during setup, you may be faced with an irritating conversation with your voice assistant. The best way to avoid some of those problems is to get a plug that works reliably, which is one of the features we considered for this guide.\n \nHow much power does a smart plug draw?\n \nSmart plugs don’t draw much more power than whatever you’re plugging into them. True, they remain on standby to await instructions from your smart assistant or other controller, so they’re always using a small amount of power. But if, for example, you set a light to automatically turn off at night, and that light would otherwise stay on unnecessarily, the smart plug will save far more energy than the watt or two extra that it draws.\n \nDo smart plugs use Bluetooth?\n \nSome smart plugs use Bluetooth to connect to your phone during setup. After that, most connect to your home’s Wi-Fi network.\n \nWhat appliances should not be plugged into a smart plug?\n \nCommon sense will help you determine what not to plug in. Obviously anything dangerous like power tools should not be plugged into a smart plug. Appliances that require supervision, such as space heaters and curling irons, shouldn’t be set to turn on automatically if no one will be around. You also shouldn’t bother with anything that needs further programming. Simple on/off appliances like lamps and fans work best.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/home/smart-home/best-smart-plug-131542429.html?src=rss",

    "summary": "As AI job losses rise in the professional sector, many are switching to more traditional trades. But how do they feel about accepting lower pay – and, in some cases, giving up their vocation?\n\nCalifornia-based Jacqueline Bowman had been dead set on becoming a writer since she was a child. At 14 she got her first internship at her local newspaper, and later she studied journalism at university. Though she hadn’t been able to make a full-time living from her favourite pastime – fiction writing – post-university, she consistently got writing work (mostly content marketing, some journalism) and went freelance full-time when she was 26. Sure, content marketing wasn’t exactly the dream, but she was writing every day, and it was paying the bills – she was happy enough.\n“But something really switched in 2024,” Bowman, now 30, says. Layoffs and publication closures meant that much of her work “kind of dried up. I started to get clients coming to me and talking about AI,” she says – some even brazen enough to tell her how “great” it was “that we don’t need writers any more”.

Close Home Tech Smartphones iPhone I ignored Apple's battery advice for months - here's how my iPhone 17 Pro Max performs now I did everything Apple tells you not to do with my iPhone 17 Pro Max, and waited. Written by Adrian Kingsley-Hughes, Senior Contributing EditorSenior Contributing Editor Feb. 10, 2026 at 6:42 p.m. PT Reviewed by Elyse Betters Picaro I've charged this iPhone in all the wrong ways... for science! Adrian Kingsley-Hughes/ZDNETFollow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google. ZDNET's key takeaways It's normal for iPhone battery health to stay at 100% for the first few months.Expect battery health to drop by 1 percentage point every 50 recharge cycles.Modern batteries are very resilient and can take a lot of abuse.My iPhone 17 Pro Max was one of the first to roll off the production line and into people's hands on launch day. Since I'd spent the previous two years absolutely babying the battery in my iPhone 15 Pro Max, I decided to take a different approach this time around.Also: After charging my iPhone the 'Apple way' for 2 years, here's the state of its battery nowI don't think it has made any difference.What I've done so farAs of today -- Feb. 7, 2026 -- my new iPhone has been through 122 recharge cycles over the past 140 days. I've had the charge limit disabled so every charge goes to 100%, and I've had Optimized Battery Charging disabled. My iPhone can't seem to figure out my schedule, as I'm somewhat erratic and don't need an alarm most of the time about 6 a.m., but I get up earlier a few days a week to get some more walking miles under my belt, so this feature doesn't work well for me. Here's how my iPhone's battery is coping so far. Adrian Kingsley-Hughes/ZDNETI also charge my iPhone both wired and wirelessly, using a huge variety of chargers and power banks, and over the past few months it has seen freezing temperatures and baking sun, sometimes not on the same day. Some days it's been run flat, and other days it's been attached to a charger or power bank all day.Oh, and the whole time, it's been inside a thick case that does nothing to keep the handset cool. Also: I changed 10+ settings on my iPhone to significantly extend its battery life (iOS 26 and older)Without doubt, I've used and abused this iPhone harder than any other I've owned, and that says a lot, yet my battery is still at 100% capacity. So, what's going on? Am I lucky? Do I have some super special battery in my iPhone that leaked from Apple's secret orbiting lab? No.The truth is that modern batteries are incredibly robust and tolerant of a great deal of misuse. Yes, things can occasionally go wrong, but when you consider the billions -- yes, billions -- of dollars of rechargeable batteries that are out there from big-name and no-name manufacturers, it's quite incredible that they're not bursting into flames all around us. In fact, your car, whether it's gasoline or an EV, is far more likely to burst into flames than your smartphone or tablet is, with gasoline-powered cars making up the bulk of fires. Also: iPhone battery worse after updating to iOS 26? Here's why, and how I fixed itAlmost all rechargeable devices make use of a charge controller or battery management chips such as the TP5100 or TP4056. These chips control things like charging speed, charge and voltage cutoffs, as well as putting thermal limitations in place so the battery doesn't get forcibly charged or discharged when it's too hot or too cold. I have projects that I put together several years ago that make use of these charge controllers, and the devices have been in continuous use without any handholding. The features that companies like Apple have built into devices, things like Optimized Battery Charging and charge limits, build on top of what the charge controllers bring to the table. Does it harm to not charge the battery to full until the last minute or to limit charge capacity to something less than 100%? No, and according to the data I've come across, there is a benefit. However, if you limit your study to consumer electronics and exclude electric vehicles, the effect is not all that big. According to Apple, the battery in my iPhone is \"designed to retain 80 percent of its original capacity at 1,000 complete charge cycles under ideal conditions.\" Note that while Apple makes this claim, the company only offers a one-year warranty for defective batteries, except in Turkey, where consumers get a two-year battery warranty thanks to stronger consumer protection laws, so the company is not prepared to back up these claims. Also: How to clear your iPhone cache (and why it makes such a big difference)Based on these figures, I expect the capacity to drop about one percentage point for every 50 recharge cycles. This equates to about two to three years of normal use. Making use of the battery settings might gain you a few weeks, but that's about it. So why is my battery still at 100% after more than 100 recharge cycles? Is it not wearing? How long until it starts to decline? Rechargeable batteries have two different capacities. There's a rated capacity, which is the capacity of the battery that the device manufacturer orders from the battery maker and puts on the spec sheet, and an actual capacity of the individual battery. The actual capacity is higher than the rated capacity to allow for manufacturing variations. No one wants to fire up a brand-new iPhone and find that the battery is already saying it is worn. Every time my iPhone is charged to full, the operating system keeps track of how much power it took. The bottom lineMy iPhone's battery is wearing, but it has not yet gone below the rated capacity, so the operating system has not yet begun to report the wear. Almost every new iPhone has this honeymoon period at the beginning where the battery seems to stick at 100% health forever... until it doesn't. Also: My iPhone 15 Pro Max battery life went from great to awful in less than two years - what happened?As soon as the actual capacity drops below the rated capacity, that maximum capacity meter will begin to tick down at around one percentage point per 50 recharge cycles. I'm very much a battery nerd, and I tracked -- obsessively, some might say -- the health of the battery in my previous iPhone. As far as the battery was concerned, I did everything right with that device, and by the two-year mark, the handset couldn't make it through a day without a recharge. I had the battery charge limit set to 80 percent, and I feel like I sacrificed a fifth of my battery's capacity for nothing. So I'm going to carry on charging my current iPhone in all the wrong ways.

Written by Kyle Kucharski, EditorEditor Feb. 10, 2026 at 6:37 p.m. PT Elyse Betters Picaro / ZDNETFollow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google. ZDNET's key takeawaysIn March, Discord will set an age lock for all users to a \"teen-appropriate experience.\"Many users will be required to complete an age verification check. These users will be required to upload a video selfie or official ID.On Monday, Discord announced a new age verification protocol that will roll out to all users in March. By default, the app will age-lock all accounts to a \"teen-appropriate experience,\" requiring proof of age to access the full experience. Unverified accounts will be blocked from servers or channels with age restrictions, unable to speak in livestream \"Stage\" channels, and unable to respond to DMs from certain users. It also won't let you change certain settings and will blur age-restricted content throughout the app. Also: 70,000 government IDs were exposed in a Discord breach - could yours be next?So, how do you prove your age to Discord? You have a few different options, including uploading a video selfie or an official government ID. If you're skeptical about uploading a selfie (or your government ID) to Discord, your concerns are warranted. Why the backlash?Just last year, the app announced that around 70,000 ID photos were leaked in a cyberattack involving its previous age verification vendor. While Discord itself wasn't a victim of the attack, the vendor lost personal information, DM history, and partial credit card details in the breach, prompting Discord to cease business with the firm.Discord's response Discord says its new third-party vendor handling age verification is much more secure, of course, highlighting that video selfies are fully processed on-device without the need to upload anything to the internet. With regards to government IDs, it says they are \"deleted quickly - in most cases, immediately after age confirmation.\" But \"deleted quickly\" is little assurance to anyone who knows how the internet works. Despite claims of security, data breaches continue across even the biggest platforms in tech, and each time, users are assured that it won't happen again. In response to Discord's age verification requirements, many users are furious and actively seeking new platforms to migrate to.Also: Disabling this Pixel app could free up to 10GB of storage space - how it worksStill, it's possible most users won't have to jump through any of these hoops if its \"age inference model\" can automatically verify your age. Discord says the model runs in the background and uses an algorithm to determine a user's age based on factors such as which servers they belong to, their behavior, and their account age. In a thread on the official Discord Reddit, a reply from an official Discord staff member, u/discord_zorkian, stated that \"the vast majority of people will never see age verification.\" The claim is that, following the rollout of age-assurance checks in the UK and Australia in 2025, the app is very good at pre-identifying most adults based on their behavior. Alternatives to considerGoing further, even if the app can't auto-verify you and you choose not to complete the process, you may still not be affected if you don't belong to certain age-restricted channels or servers. While there's no direct replacement for Discord at the moment, users across various online forums have suggested decentralized services like Matrix and Stoat Chat, as well as Slack, for their similar interfaces and ease of communication.Discord's global rollout of age verification is scheduled for early March 2026, with no specific date yet set. It's likely there will be in-app notifications on the process in the coming weeks. Featured Want local vibe coding?

All you need to sign up is a participating library card. You're limited to 10 titles per month. If you're tired of ever-increasing streaming prices, there's a good chance you have access to a free streaming service with a fairly impressive catalog of titles -- all thanks to your local library.Kanopy is a streaming app that's available for iOS, Android, Apple TV, Chromecast, and Roku devices. Also: The 7 best free video streaming services: Watch TV and movies for freeNo charge, on-demand titles include popular movies like \"The Wolf of Wall Street,\" \"The Truman Show,\" and \"Into the Wild,\" classic films, PBS content, the Criterion Collection, the Great Courses, (which lets you stream over 18,000 lectures in history, science, philosophy, religion, literature, health, travel, and more) documentaries, world cinema, and more. There's even a Kanopy Kids section and seasonal Halloween and Christmas selections that rotate out. The service adds new titles often.How to stream Kanopy for free with your library cardHead to kanopy.com and click \"Get Started\" (you can also download the Android or iOS app). Choose \"Find Your Library\" and enter your ZIP code, or choose \"Find Your University\" if you're a student or college professor. Not every library system is on the list, but Kanopy says more than 4,000 libraries around the world have access to its free streaming content. If your local library isn't listed, a large system near you probably offers a non-resident card. My county's system wasn't available, but I can get a card from the next county over for $40. That obviously takes away from the free aspect of the service, but it's more than worth it for everything else included.Also: Your Roku just got a several new channels (including sports and games) - free of chargeOnce you log in with your library card number, click \"Continue\" and finish creating your Kanopy account. Click \"Sign Up,\" and you're ready to start streaming.Kanopy notes that local libraries do have to pay a small fee each time you watch a title, so some counties do have a limit (most I've seen are around 10-12). Still, it's an excellent value that lets you watch a few movies a week. When your time with each title is up, it disappears from your library. There's nothing you need to do, and there are no late fees. It seems like another service gets a price increase every month, so if you've been looking for a chance to save a little money streaming, this may be an opportunity.Featured Want local vibe coding?

You can also access your favorite channels from the recently watched section after you've viewed them once.

If, after spending a few days using a model or AI solution, I reach the \"frak this\" stage, then the model has failed the DPQ.In previous months, both Claude Code and OpenAI Codex have passed the DPQ. Goose, combined with Ollama and Qwen3-coder, failed the DPQ miserably when faced with a larger scale project. (Disclosure: Ziff Davis, ZDNET's parent company, filed an April 2025 lawsuit against OpenAI, alleging it infringed Ziff Davis copyrights in training and operating its AI systems.) The assignment If you've been following my articles, you know I built a filament inventory management app using Claude Code. It uses NFC tags to help me track the spools of filament I'm using, and which machine each spool is currently assigned to. Also: Claude Code made an astonishing $1B in 6 months - and my own AI-coded iPhone app shows whyI know it's not a problem everyone has, but that's the value of vibe coding. I don't have to justify years of development with a product team or a big ROI. I just have to have a need and the basic skill to instruct an AI. For this project, Claude Code has already built me working iPhone, Mac, and Apple Watch implementations. But, for completeness sake, I wanted an iPad app. Also: I used Claude Code to vibe code a Mac app in 8 hours, but it was more work than magicThat's the project I decided to give to Goose and its buddies. Goose didn't have to design the thing from scratch. What it had to do was decide what features to take from the Mac implementation (in particular, the big screen user interface) and what features to take from the iPhone implementation (in particular, the photo features), and merge them into a new iPad build. There's already a ton of institutional knowledge in the project, not just in the source code, but also in all the notes, status, and documentation files I've been diligent in requiring Claude Code to create. The preparation This is a potentially dangerous experiment. Going in, I had no idea if the Goose Buddies were going to improve on the existing code, or destroy it (spoiler: destroy-ish). Therefore, I made a full ZIP backup of the entire project directory and moved that off my development machine. I also gave these instructions to Claude Code:I have been given the assignment to evaluate a new AI coder on the team. It will be given the assignment of porting the filament project to the iPad, and merging the larger user interface of the Mac with the photo-taking features of the iPhone. NFC is not supported on the iPad. I need your help both before and after this programming test. Before, I want you to fully audit and catalog the project so if the new programmer AI fails, and leaves the code in a problematic state, you can revert to a known good condition. As a backup to that, I will also ZIP up a full copy of the entire project directory once you finish this phase. After the programming test, which will occur in a later session (not now), I will want you to audit the new work. You will examine the code the new programmer AI has created for the iPad app. You will also examine the code for the iOS, Mac, and Watch implementations to make sure the new programmer AI didn't make damaging changes. Claude went off and built tracking data, which I thought it might need to bring the project back to a functioning state. And then I set Goose loose. Goose desktop I started using the Goose desktop app on my Mac Studio machine. I went into Ollama (the LLM server) and gave Qwen3-coder the largest context window it would allow. Then, I told it: \"Read all the documents and .MD files, and completely bring yourself up to speed on what is in this project.\"It read the information, but didn't really seem to pay full attention. It identified some of the elements in the project, but completely missed that there was an Apple Watch implementation. Also: I used Claude Code to vibe code an Apple Watch app in just 12 hours - instead of 2 monthsWhen I pointed that error out, Goose told me, \"You're absolutely right, and I apologize for that oversight. I haven't actually examined the WatchOS implementation thoroughly. Let me take a more comprehensive look at the WatchOS portion of this project.\" After it ran, it did seem to have a better understanding of what was in the existing code. So then, I asked it, \"What elements are you going to take from the MacOS version, and what elements will you take from the iOS/iPhone version?\" Remember that the Mac gives us a bigger screen, while the iPhone gives us photo capabilities. But since iPads don't support NFC, the NFC capability shouldn't move over. To its credit, Goose did pick up on the wider screen from the Mac implementation and the photo features from the iPhone implementation. But it insisted it could also bring over the NFC features. I tried a few guided discovery questions, like \"What did you get wrong?\" and \"What are you missing about this approach?\" After about four tries, Goose finally identified the fact that iPads don't have the necessary NFC capability. Then I told it to go ahead and plan the iPad implementation. Now, here's something you need to know. iOS (for the iPhone) and iPadOS (for the iPad) share the same core operating system. From Apple's internal perspective, iPadOS is a fork or variant of iOS, not a separate OS in the way MacOS is. Even so, some system behaviors are iPad-only (windowing, pointer support, multitasking), some APIs are available only on iPadOS, or behave differently there, and both Apple documents and WWDC sessions explicitly distinguish iOS vs iPadOS. So when Goose came back and insisted it would create an iOS version of the iPad app, I had to push back. Goose could not distinguish between the iPadOS and iOS versions, even after I sent it on web searches. This process of narrowing down a plan took a few hours, where I mostly felt like I was arguing with a stubborn and willfully uncooperative grad student. Also: I did 24 days of coding in 12 hours with a $20 AI tool - but there's one big pitfallEventually, it seemed to understand that the iPad would be able to support windows, pointers, and multitasking, so I decided to see if it could build the app. The answer to that, at least for now, was a big \"No.\" Goose told me it can't modify actual Xcode project files. It can't add new targets to the project. It can't make \"real\" file changes. I went down another rabbit hole trying to coerce and convince Goose that since I had access to those directories, it should as well. There was no joy. I eventually asked it why Claude Code could do it, and Goose could not. I was told it was because Claude Code was running in the terminal and could run terminal commands. Goose CLI (running in terminal) Hey, I'm nothing if not intrepid. So I pointed my browser at Goose's GitHub repo and downloaded the Mac CLI version using the helpful cURL command provided. That install found my Ollama installation and the Qwen3-coder model, so once it was downloaded, I had a full, working Goose AI environment in my terminal. One step forward. As soon as I had Goose running, I hit return an extra time. That's a habit of mine. I like clearing a little space in the terminal. Usually, hitting return on a blank line doesn't do anything. There was nothing on the command line. But Goose decided that I wanted it to build a Mac app. So, even though there already was a running Mac app, Goose decided to try doing it again. Also: I've tested free vs. paid AI coding tools - here's which one I'd actually useFortunately, after running for about ten minutes, it failed because it couldn't access any files. Two steps back. Here's another weird little quirk. Goose randomly does stuff. I don't know why, but it does stuff. For example, I hit return on a blank line again, and this time it decided to add 375 lines and take out 7. I don't know why or where. It just seemed to like the idea. I once again went through the familiarization steps with Goose, repeating the work I did in the desktop version. I once again had to prompt it a few times, until I was sure that Goose actually read the instructions, and wasn't doing the AI equivalent of sitting in the back of the classroom hiding a Nintendo Switch behind a textbook while pretending to read the project guidelines. Then, we once again had to have the debate about iOS vs iPadOS, and the debate about whether or not an iPad could support NFC. You could almost visibly see the DPQ ticking down. We eventually reached the point where Goose seemed to grok the assignment. So, I gave it the go to build. Goose once again responded with the claim it couldn't modify files. Also: Why your coding skills are more essential than ever in the AI ageNow, here's where it gets weird. I simply asked it, \"The file system is not read-only. If you do not have access to the files, what do you need to do or request to gain access?\" It never answered me. But it then proceeded to code what it claimed was the iPad app. It reported to me, \"iPad Implementation Complete.\" Frak this But the iPad implementation was not complete. When I tried to run it in Xcode, I got a page full of errors. Screenshot by David Gewirtz/ZDNETNow, here's where we encounter one of the Goose terminal implementation's biggest limitations: you can't paste in or otherwise provide screenshots. With both OpenAI's Codex and Anthropic's Claude Code, I can take a screenshot of the error screen (or any other screen), feed it to the AI, and the AI will take action. Not so with Goose. Also: 10 things I wish I knew before trusting Claude Code to build my iPhone appXcode won't let you select all the errors and copy them as text, so I had to OCR that page and then pass that generated text to Goose. Goose worked on those errors and gave me back another version it declared as \"iPad Implementation -- COMPLETE.\" There were even more errors this time. Screenshot by David Gewirtz/ZDNETThe code was actually getting progressively worse. Goose also sometimes returns with incomplete results. Here's an example where it appears to be returning with results, but then goes in some other direction. Screenshot by David Gewirtz/ZDNETTen minutes later, after appearing to do the same process twice in a row, it came back and told me that, \"I have successfully implemented the iPad version with all the features and optimizations requested.\" I've been at this now for six hours. I don't have anything that works. I'm convinced it's getting worse. Hence: frak this. DPQ = 0. Maybe, maybe not Can I definitively say that Goose can't do the job? No, I can't. I lost patience after six hours. I think my irritability is justified, because I've spent months with other coding AI implementations that work far more smoothly. As an independent developer whose projects rarely justify their investment monetarily beyond my own learnings, an occasional productivity boost, and the importance of keeping my chops up, spending $100 or $200 a month is a bit of a reach. My time is very valuable to me. I already work seven days a week, and if I have to spend a ton of hours fighting with a free AI, I'm not saving anything. Claude Code or ChatGPT Codex are far better investments, even if they don't pay out in a cash money return on that investment. I suspect Goose, Ollama, and Qwen3-coder will get better because that's what AIs do. You might even be able to gut it out, and work through getting Goose and its buddies to do the job now. Also: 'I lost two hours of my day' - why workers are frustrated with AIBut the fact is, Goose is not at Claude Code's level. Even in my simple test, Goose failed five times before it got it right. With this larger project, who knows how bad it is? Actually, Claude Code does. Remember I asked it to do a pre-run audit? Claude told me two things. First, Goose, \"Mangled the struct body so badly that SwiftUI expressions ended up at the top level outside any struct. Later reverted.\" In other words, Goose broke the code, but later removed those changes. Goose claimed, \"The git diff confirms: Added iPad detection logic, Implemented NavigationSplitView for iPad layout, Maintained original iPhone layout, Preserved all existing functionality, Properly excluded NFC features from iPad interface.\" But Claude Code reported, \"The irony. None of that exists. The only thing it actually did was temporarily break the one file it touched.\" Bottom line Here's my bottom line: I don't think the Goose/Ollama/Qwen3-coder team-up is ready for prime time yet. You can probably get it to work if you spend a lot of time fiddling with it. You would also have to be willing to ride very close herd over the results and test super-carefully. If you just want to tinker and you have small scale projects, go ahead and try Goose. But if you have any time management concerns and want to produce production code of any sort, I'd go with either Codex or Claude Code. Also: Want local vibe coding? This AI stack replaces Claude Code and Codex - and it's freePersonally, I just don't have that much time to waste. What about you? Have you experimented with local or open-source coding AIs like Goose, Ollama, or Qwen, or are you sticking with paid tools like Claude Code or Codex? How much friction are you willing to tolerate to save on subscription costs? Do you think local models are close to being viable for larger, multi-target projects, or are they still best suited for small experiments? And how do you evaluate whether an AI coding tool is actually helping versus quietly making things worse?

Close Home Home & Office Home Entertainment TVs How to disable ACR on your TV - and why it makes such a big difference doing so Your Samsung, LG, and even TCL TV comes with risks you should know about. Here's how to avoid one of the biggest. Written by Chris Bayer, EditorEditor Feb. 10, 2026 at 6:13 p.m. PT Adam Breeden/ZDNETFollow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.ZDNET's key takeawaysSmart TVs track viewing habits with ACR tech.Collected data fuels billions in targeted ads.Turning off ACR protects privacy but takes effort.Did you know that whenever you turn on your smart TV, you invite an unseen guest to watch it with you?These days, most mainstream TVs use automatic content recognition (ACR), a type of ad-tracking technology that collects data on everything you watch and sends it to a central database. Manufacturers then use this information to understand your viewing habits and deliver highly targeted ads.Also: Own a Samsung TV? I changed these 6 settings to make the system run like new againWhat's the incentive behind this invasive technology? According to market research firm eMarketer, in 2022, advertisers spent an estimated $18.6 billion on smart TV ads, and these numbers are expected to continue rising. To understand how ACR works, imagine a constant, real-time Shazam-like service running in the background while your TV is on. It identifies content displayed on your screen, including programs from cable TV boxes, streaming services, or gaming consoles. ACR does this by capturing continuous screenshots and cross-referencing them with a vast database of media content and advertisements. According to The Markup, ACR can capture and identify up to 7,200 images per hour, or approximately two images every second. This extensive tracking provides valuable insights for marketers and content distributors, as it reveals connections between viewers' personal information and their preferred content. By \"personal information,\" I mean email addresses, IP addresses -- and even your physical street address. Also: Your Roku has hidden settings and menu screens - here's how to unlock themBy understanding what viewers watch and engage with, marketers can make decisions on content recommendations to create bespoke advertising placements. They can also track advertisements that lead to purchases. But the most disturbing part is the potential for exploitation. In the wrong hands, sensitive information gathered through ACR could be exploited or misused, potentially resulting in security risks or, in extreme cases, identity theft. Because ACR operates clandestinely in the background, many of us aren't even aware of its active presence each time we're enjoying our favorite shows. Opting out of using ACR is complex and sometimes challenging. Navigating through your TV settings might take several dozen clicks to protect your privacy better. If you, like me, perceive this feature as intrusive or unsettling, there's a way to disable this data collection feature on your smart TV. It may take some patience, but below is a How-To list for five major brands that demonstrates how to turn off ACR. How to turn off ACR on a smart TV For Samsung TVs… Press the Home button on your remote control.Navigate to the left to access the sidebar menu.In the sidebar menu, choose the Privacy Choices option.Select the Terms & Conditions, Privacy Policy option.Ensure that the checkbox for Viewing Information Services is unchecked. This will turn off ACR and any associated ad targeting.Select the OK option at the bottom of the screen to confirm your changes. Show more For an LG TV… Press the Home button on your remote control to access the home screen.Press the Settings button on your remote.In the settings side menu, select the Settings option.Navigate to and select the General option.In the General menu, choose System.Select Additional Settings.In Additional Settings, locate and toggle off the Live Plus option.LG further allows you to limit ad tracking, which can be found in Additional Settings.In the Additional Settings menu, select Advertisement.Toggle on the Limit AD Tracking option.You can also turn off home promotions and content recommendations:In the Additional Settings menu, select Home Settings. Uncheck the Home Promotion option. Uncheck the Content Recommendation option. Show more For a Sony TV… Press the Home button on your remote control to access the main menu.Navigate to and select Settings.Choose Initial Setup.Scroll down and select Samba Interactive TV.Select Disable to turn off Samba TV, which is Sony's ACR technology.Sony also allows for enhanced privacy by disabling ad personalization:Go to Settings.Select About.Choose Ads.Turn off Ads Personalization.Also: Can't hear TV dialogue? This portable soundbar solved my audio problems for cheapAs an extra step, you can entirely disable the Samba Services Manager, which is embedded in the firmware of certain Sony Bravia TVs as a third-party interactive app.Go to Settings.Select Apps.Select Samba Services Manager.Choose Clear Cache.Select Force Stop.Finally, select Disable.If your Sony TV uses Android TV, you should also turn off data collection for Chromecast:Open the Google Home app on your smartphone.Tap the Menu icon.Select your TV from the list of devices.Tap the three dots in the upper right corner.Choose Settings.Turn off Send Chromecast device usage data and crash reports. Show more For a Hisense TV… Press the Home button on your remote control to access the main menu.Navigate to and select Settings.Choose System.Select Privacy.Look for an option called Smart TV Experience, Viewing Information Services, or something similar.Toggle this option off to disable ACR.Also: Is your Roku TV spying on you? It's possible, but here's how you can easily stop itTo disable personalized ads and opt out of content recommendations:In the Privacy menu, look for an option like Ad Tracking or Interest-Based Ads.Turn this option off.Look for options related to content recommendations or personalized content.Disable these features if you don't want the TV to suggest content based on your viewing habits. Show more For a TCL TV (and other Roku-powered TVs)… Press the Home button on your TCL TV remote control.Navigate to and select Settings in the main menu.Scroll down and select the Privacy option.Look for Smart TV Experience and select it.Uncheck or toggle off the option labeled Use Info from TV Inputs.Also: Slow Fire TV? 10 settings I changed to dramatically improve the performanceFor extra privacy, TCL TVs offer a few more options, all of which can be found in the Privacy menu:Select Advertising.Choose Limit ad tracking.Again, select Advertising.Uncheck Personalized ads.Now, still in the Privacy menu, select Microphone.Adjust Channel Microphone Access and Channel Permissions as desired. Show more Remember that while these steps will significantly reduce data collection, they may also limit some smart features of your TV. Also, it's a good idea to periodically check these settings to ensure they remain as you've set them. Especially after software updates, your revised settings may sometimes revert to their default state.Also: How to clear your TV cache (and why you shouldn't wait to do it)The driving force behind targeted advertisements on smart TVs is ACR technology, and its inclusion speaks volumes about manufacturers' focus on monetizing user data rather than prioritizing consumer interests. For most of us, ACR offers few tangible benefits, while the real-time sharing of our viewing habits and preferences exposes us to potential privacy risks. By disabling ACR, you can help keep your data to yourself and enjoy viewing with some peace of mind. Editor's note: This article was first published in 2024.

Close Home Tech Computing Tablets How I turned my Android tablet into a dedicated e-reader (and it works on iPad, too) There's no need for a separate device when your iPad or Android tablet can hold your whole reading library. Written by Maria Diaz, Staff WriterStaff Writer Feb. 10, 2026 at 6:00 p.m. PT Kerry Wan/ZDNETFollow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.Tablets can already do everything that e-readers do, so turning one into an e-reader is easier than you think. However, there are reasons people buy dedicated e-readers instead of tablets, including the fact that they can cause eye strain and are filled with distractions. With a few tweaks, any iPad or Android tablet can feel pretty close to an e-reader. Also: I've tried dozens of E Ink tablets, but this Android checks more of my boxes than any otherYour tablet can become your personal library and even do a better job than a dedicated device. Like e-readers, tablets let you read digital books, but they also tend to have more storage than dedicated devices, so you can carry thousands of titles at once. Tablets are also more versatile, so you can add your own books and use multiple apps to read. How to turn a tablet into an e-reader 1. Weed out distractions Maria Diaz/ZDNET Look through the apps on the tablet you plan to use as an e-reader and remove any that will be a distraction. If you'd rather keep the tablet strictly for reading, remove social media and games, then silence your notifications. You can turn on Do Not Disturb or, on an iPad, set a specific Focus mode for reading. Show more 2. Find reading apps Maria Diaz/ZDNET Add your favorite reading apps, like the Kindle app (available on iOS and Android) and Libby, which gives you access to your public library's digital catalog. As a Kindle Unlimited subscriber, the Kindle app is one of the first ones I add to a new tablet, as I can access my Kindle Library from anywhere. Also: How to add EPUB, MOBI, and PDF files to your Kindle - no converting requiredApple and Google each have Books apps with built-in stores if you're looking to shop around. You can also add news apps and any files you have to your reading tablet. Show more 3. Reduce the glare (and eye strain) Maria Diaz/ZDNET Eye strain is one of the biggest cons of using a tablet as a dedicated e-reader. This type of fatigue is caused by glare and light temperature, so adding a matte screen protector to your tablet can make reading more comfortable for long periods. You can find matte screen protectors for most tablets on the market, and they're pretty cheap, starting at $5 for a two-pack. Show more 4. Make your tablet more eye-friendly Maria Diaz/ZDNET Many tablets on the market feature settings you can tweak to improve eye comfort. Changing your tablet's backlight temperature to favor a warmer tone and switching its display to dark mode will make it easier on your eyes. A lot of tablets have built-in eye comfort features that automatically do this for you; just find these in your settings. Show more 5. Add accessories for comfort Kayla Solino/ZDNET A Kindle is a handheld e-reader that is light enough to carry in one hand for easy reading, but third-party accessories like a Strapsicle can make almost any tablet comfortable enough for reading. Though Strapsicles are for Kindles, Strapsicle is working on new iPad cases coming soon.Also: My favorite Kindle accessory brand just released an iPad case at CES - and it's pure geniusSimilarly, other brands offer hand straps to hold tablets in one hand, including CoBak. I've been using one of these straps on my TCL Nxtpaper 11 tablet for months, which has made it easier to use such a large tablet for reading. Show more More accessories to turn your tablet into an e-reader Maria Diaz/ZDNETThere are many accessories available to help you use your tablet for long periods without distractions or eye fatigue. Here are other accessories you can add to your tablet to make it feel more like an e-reader:You can get a tablet stand for your desk, lap, or a floor stand to hold your tablet at the perfect height for your eyes. A distraction-removing app can also block all apps from interrupting you during reading, kind of like a Brick device does for your phone. Many e-reader users love a good page turner remote, myself included. These work to control your touchscreens, so you can read and turn pages without having to touch the screen. This has been a fun addition to read in bed, and is especially liked by readers who use a stand.Featured Want local vibe coding?

    "full_text": "Innovation Home Innovation Artificial Intelligence 'I lost two hours of my day' - the harsh reality of AI in the workplace AI adoption is up while employee confidence in the technology is down. A ManpowerGroup report explains why. Written by Erin Carson, Managing Editor, News & FeaturesManaging Editor, News & Features Feb. 10, 2026 at 5:55 p.m. PT MirageC/Getty ImagesFollow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.ZDNET's key takeawaysDespite mass AI adoption, workers' confidence in the tech fell. One factor could be a lack of training.Companies are looking for ways to mitigate frustration.For every process or workflow where AI saves time and boosts efficiency, there are a half dozen that leave Tabby Farrar's team feeling like the technology is useless. Farrar is head of search at the UK-based SEO and web design agency Candour. Digital marketing, like nearly every other industry, is heatedly debating the topic of AI. And though her team is keen to embrace the benefits of working faster and more efficiently, and of clawing back time otherwise spent on less interesting tasks, it doesn't always work that way. Also: 95% of business applications of AI have failed. Here's whyAI can generate product lifestyle imagery for clients who don't have any, but it hallucinates or misses key points when creating executive summaries of data. Refining a prompt to help assign categories to datasets could take so long, Farrar might as well have done the job manually. \"As a manager, I'm trying to get the team more on board with AI stuff, because it's the future of so many industries,\" Farrar said. On the other hand, \"There's just so many people going, 'I have lost two hours of my day trying to make this thing work.'\"Farrar and her team aren't the only ones navigating the gap between what AI promises and what it can actually do -- and perhaps losing faith in the meantime. Worker anxiety will cause real problemsA January study from workforce solutions firm ManpowerGroup found that for the first time in three years, workers' confidence in AI declined, dropping 18% while adoption grew by 13% year over year. The divergence in those numbers may not only signal that the honeymoon phase with AI is over, but also serve as a wake-up call for organizations about how they implement AI tools in the workplace. \"You can't have an intimidated workforce and be fully productive. That anxiety is going to cause real problems,\" said Mara Stefan, VP of global insights for ManpowerGroup.Other studies paint similar portraits of disconnect. An EY report from November found that while 9 in 10 employees use AI at work, only 28% of organizations can translate that into \"high-value outcomes.\" \"Our research shows why: Employees may be saving a few hours here and there, but nothing that fundamentally changes how work gets done or how the business performs,\" the report said.For some, trying to prevent this erosion of workers' confidence is a part-time job. Also: 5 ways you can stop testing AI and start scaling it responsibly in 2026Randall Tinfow, CEO of REACHUM, an AI-powered learning platform based in Scranton, Pa., estimates he spends about 20 hours of his 70-hour work week vetting AI tools and partners, so as not to turn them loose on his employees indiscriminately. While platforms like Claude Code are saving software developers at REACHUM significant time, not everything is as effective. Tinfow sees a disparity between how some AI tools are marketed and what they can actually do. Even working at a company built around AI, Tinfow's team has run into issues with tasks like text generation in images, where certain AI tools just didn't deliver. \"There's so much noise, and I don't want our team to get distracted by that, so I'm the one who will take a look at something, decide whether it is reasonable or garbage, and then give it to the team to work with,\" Tinfow said.Boosting confidenceThat misalignment of expectations and reality could be one key reason for the confidence drop, said Kristin Ginn, founder of trnsfrmAItn, an organization that works with companies on AI adoption, focusing on the human workforce involved. Marketing demos make it all look easy, but business leaders have to make sure workers understand the trial-and-error and refinement that may lie ahead. There's also a psychological element at play. ManpowerGroup's study found that 89% of respondents feel comfortable in their current role. For many, they've done their jobs one way for a long time. Also: 5 ways rules and regulations can help guide your AI innovation\"If you're now starting to look at how you can use AI for the same task, you all of a sudden have to put a lot more mental effort into trying to figure out how to do this in a completely different way,\" Ginn said, \"That loss of the routine, the confidence of how I'm doing it, that can also just go back to the human nature to avoid change.\"Additionally, Stefan discussed the role adequate training plays in maintaining confidence. More than half of respondents (56%) reported no recent training or access to mentorship (57%).\"The organizations and the companies that figure out how to address that, how to make employees feel better about the use of technology, the training, and the context… those are the organizations that are going to benefit the most,\" Stefan said.Looking for gemsBack at the digital marketing agency Candour, Farrar said the company has a variety of tactics to help balance the quest for innovation with the day-to-day challenges of a technology that still has a way to go. Candour builds in extra time to account for the fact that everyone is learning, frames experiments as \"test and learn\" to mitigate stress, and has appointed a \"champion\" to stay abreast of developments in AI. The agency's chief marketing officer has led training sessions, and Farrar also does regular check-ins with her team. She's open with them about feeling frustrated sometimes, too.Also: Turn AI chaos into a career opportunity by preparing for these 4 scenariosAnd some efforts have proven fruitful, like the creation of a Gemini Gem trained on brand and tone-of-voice guidelines that can generate quotes a client can then tweak and approve for use in media. Candour's innovation lead is building tools that will more specifically meet the company's needs using APIs from companies like OpenAI. Farrar described how quickly their attitude toward AI images changed after the launch of Google's Nano Banana -- for the better. Still, there's a long road ahead. \"If I am going to sideline some of my work over to these tools,\" Farrar said, \"I want to be able to trust that it's going to do as good a job as I would do.\"Featured Want local vibe coding?

Close Home Tech Computing Tablets This handheld e-reader has effectively replaced my Kindle, and the price is hard to beat The DuRobo Krono is one of the few e-reading devices that fits comfortably in my pants. Written by Maria Diaz, Staff WriterStaff Writer Feb. 10, 2026 at 5:45 p.m. PT DuRobo Krono ZDNET's key takeaways The DuRobo Krono is a smartphone-sized ePaper tablet, available for $280. The Android-based Krono is meant to be a distraction-free device for reading, note-taking, and productivity. Following a successful Kickstarter campaign, the Krono is now shipping to customers. View now at Durobo Follow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.As an avid book lover, I'm a sucker for a great e-reader. But the problem is that many of these devices are way too limited to become a companion device. This is why I loved the TCL Nxtpaper tablet so much. There's another device, however: the new DuRobo Krono is here to address that tablet's downfall: it's a pocket e-reader and productivity device that is finally available for purchase.Also: I stopped using a dedicated e-reader when I found out my tablet could do this insteadAdmittedly, I am biased. I've been using a prototype of the DuRobo Krono for a couple of months, and it's done what no e-reader has before: it's the only one that has replaced my Kindle while traveling. As an adult, I've never traveled without my Kindle because I like being able to read on the plane and before bed. I could read on my phone with the Kindle app, but the eye-friendly ePaper display hits the spot better than any other device. Maria Diaz/ZDNETDuRobo markets the Krono as a \"focus hub,\" offering more functionalities than a Kindle, but less digital clutter than a smartphone. The DuRobo Krono is small and lightweight enough to make a compelling Kindle replacement, and its added features bring it over the top. Describing the DuRobo Krono as a simple e-reader is a major injustice. It's an e-paper Android tablet that works as a smartphone-sized productivity device. Its long battery life and Android-based OS make it more reliable than your average e-reader, without being as cumbersome or heavy as even a Kindle. Also: No Matter? No problem! Imagine one smart home app to control all your devicesI've sung the praises of the TCL Nxtpaper 11 tablet for quite some time, and the only drawback I've found is that it's simply too large and heavy to read comfortably in bed when I hold it up. The Kindle is much smaller, but the more compact DuRobo Krono is lighter than all of them, weighing 6.13 ounces -- about the same as my husband's iPhone 13. Maria Diaz/ZDNET\"Krono was created for thinkers and creators who crave mental clarity,\" a DuRoBo spokesperson recently said about the device. \"By combining thoughtful design, open software, and intelligent assistance, we're giving people a new kind of digital space—one that helps them focus, reflect, and create without distractions.\"Also: The 13 most useful smart home devices I saw at CES 2026 (and would buy if I could)The Krono features a built-in AI assistant that enables easy note recording by simply pressing a button, which then transcribes and summarizes the notes for you -- a feature that has turned out to be quite convenient for me as a writer. Maria Diaz/ZDNETI use the Spark feature to dictate to the Krono and share thoughts and story ideas. The device then transcribes the information, which I can access as needed or use the built-in AI to generate a summary. The DuRobo Krono also features a built-in AI assistant called Libby AI, which can be accessed from the home screen by double-pressing the Smart Dial. Libby AI can respond to prompts similar to those of other popular AI assistants, including ChatGPT. It can also generate summaries, provide news updates, and help you create outlines.Also: Why the Mini LED TV I recommend to most people in 2026 isn't made by TCL or SamsungA 6.1-inch Carta 1200 HD display supports 300 ppi and color temperature adjustments, and is flanked by a rotating dial on the left and a wake button on the right. You can rotate the Smart Dial to adjust the display's brightness or long-press it to quickly record a voice note. Maria Diaz/ZDNETThe battery life is outstanding, especially when the Krono is used mostly for reading. It has a 3,950mAh battery, which is about midrange among smartphones. Yet the Krono is so efficient that I can go weeks without charging it. During my week at CES, I used the DuRobo Krono nightly to read and take notes with the AI assistant, and after six days of use, the battery only consumed about a third of its capacity. ZDNET's buying adviceIn my experience, the Durobo Krono is ideal for professionals, readers, or individuals seeking a mostly distraction-free device that is lightweight and slim enough to fit in a pocket. It's a good fit for users who prefer reading books, articles, or even PDFs without phone glare or pesky notifications. The DuRobo Krono features 128GB of storage, allowing it to handle a wide range of documents, apps, voice recordings, and books. It's now commercially available, with a preorder price of $280, and orders are shipping now.Featured reviews I spent weeks with Alexa on the Echo Show 11, and it was awesome (until I started fact-checking) Sony LinkBuds Clip vs. Bose QuietComfort Open: This model wins big I replaced my bedroom TV with a $180 Roku projector - and don't regret it I found the Lenovo ThinkPad to rule them all - and its modular RAM changes everything I spent weeks with Alexa on the Echo Show 11, and it was awesome (until I started fact-checking) Sony LinkBuds Clip vs. Bose QuietComfort Open: This model wins big I replaced my bedroom TV with a $180 Roku projector - and don't regret it I found the Lenovo ThinkPad to rule them all - and its modular RAM changes everything Editorial standards Show Comments Log In to Comment Community Guidelines Related How I turned my Android tablet into a dedicated e-reader (and it works on iPad, too) I wasn't looking to ditch my Kindle, but this Android e-reader convinced me big time Why I replaced my Kindle with an iPad Mini for reading ebooks - and don't regret it"

Close Home Tech Wearables Headphones My simple tweaks that bring dead-sounding headphones back to life - Sony and Bose included Are your headphones feeling old? Consider these tweaks before upgrading. Written by Jada Jones, EditorEditor Feb. 10, 2026 at 5:42 p.m. PT Jada Jones/ZDNETFollow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.ZDNET's key takeawaysIf you're mulling a headphone upgrade, try these tips first.Updating firmware fixes more performance issues than you'd think.Using different EQ settings for different media can liven the audio performance.New headphones regularly hit the market, and as someone who often wears the latest and greatest ones, I can attest that the novelty wears off more quickly than with other consumer electronics. Headphones have a surprisingly lengthy lifespan, and if curiosity alone is what's driving you to consider buying a new pair, try tinkering with your current pair before welcoming a potential case of buyer's remorse.Also: Spotify vs. Apple Music: I've used both music streaming services, and my choice is clearIf your headphones are still comfortable, hold their battery well, and you're satisfied with their audio performance, but you're feeling bored with them, here are some tips to rekindle the romance between you and your daily driver.Problem: Buggy, low-performing, or connectivity issuesSolution: Update your firmwareHeadphone firmware updates don't arrive often, but when they do, they can include significant changes that completely change your experience in minutes. Your headphones' digital signal processing is usually updated via firmware, which can improve frequency response, noise cancellation, Bluetooth connection stability, and power management.Also: I spoke with Bluetooth reps about the future of connected audio, and it's cooler than I expectedFollowing a firmware update, it's not uncommon to notice that your headphones sound better, their noise cancellation feels smoother, their microphone call quality is enhanced, or their transparency mode sounds more natural. By keeping your headphones updated, you may find they're a totally different pair than when you first bought them.It's easy to turn on your headphones, have them automatically connect to your phone, and rarely open their companion app. However, you've likely missed the notification to update your headphones' firmware, and they won't update themselves. Problem: They sound boringSolution: Tinker with EQMaintaining the same EQ settings across the different media you consume can lead to a flat or boring-sounding response. However, a well-applied EQ setting can bring out parts of a song you've never noticed before, or make your favorite podcast sound clearer than ever.Also: Are the Sonos Ace still worth it in 2026? I've tested dozens of headphones, and it's a resounding yesSome people avoid their headphones' equalizer because they feel intimidated by the numbers and symbols that represent frequency components. Many headphone apps include a five or six-band equalizer, and even if you don't understand what you're looking at, your ears will translate the different frequencies for you.You'll immediately notice a sonic difference, and altered EQ settings can be more impactful than purchasing new headphones, especially if your budget is under $450.Problem: You can't get that new pair out of your headSolution: Spend one-on-one time with your current pairWhen you get a new pair of headphones, you're more likely to put them on and pay close attention to how they feel and sound. Then, you fall back into your typical pattern of wearing them while completing other tasks, such as working, commuting, exercising, or traveling, and the headphones fade into the background again.Also: Are the Sonos Ace still worth it in 2026? I've tested dozens of headphones, and it's a resounding yesOnce you update your headphones and tinker with the audio settings, sit down and intently focus on their audio response. Reset your headphones' headband and ensure they're in an optimal position for audio performance and comfort. There's a chance you have the upgrade itch because you've exhausted one listening mode, and you need a refresh to fall in love again. The bottom lineModern headphones are preference-focused, and hardware or software upgrades are incremental. Thus, certain brands produce headphones tailored to specific lifestyles or software ecosystems. Once you've found the brand that works best for you, there's a good chance you don't need to upgrade within that same brand just yet. Apple's AirPods Max (2020), Sony's WH-1000XM4 (2020), and Bose's QuietComfort 45 (2021) are great examples of this; they each serve their target audiences well, and continued updates only make them better. If you've met anyone with these headphones, I'm confident they'll tell you they've had them for years and have no desire to upgrade.Also: The best headphones and earbuds of 2026To put this idea in perspective, the re-released AirPods Max (2024) feature the same hardware as the 2020 version, aside from the introduction of a USB-C port. Bose hasn't updated the drivers in its premium headphones since 2019, but has released two new pairs since then. If your headphones are five years old or less, don't rush to upgrade yet. It's less likely that you need a new pair altogether; you may just need new experiences with your current pair. When it is time to upgrade, ZDNET has tested dozens of headphones and hand-picked the best ones.Featured Want local vibe coding?

Written by Jada Jones, EditorEditor Feb. 10, 2026 at 5:36 p.m. PT Kyle Kucharski/ZDNETFollow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.ZDNET's key takeawaysMicrosoft is adopting Bluetooth LE Audio in some of its Windows 11 PCs.Bluetooth LE Audio brings audio sharing and super wideband to Windows 11.Your laptop and hearing device must be compatible with Bluetooth LE Audio.Microsoft is rolling out shared audio support to compatible Windows 11 PCs, allowing users to broadcast audio from the PC to two compatible audio accessories. Some PC models received this feature last October and November, while others received it as recently as late January. In a blog post, Microsoft explains that users can share music with a friend or watch a movie together while traveling. To try this feature, users can enable their compatible Windows 11 Copilot + PC in the Windows Dev or Beta Channels and install the latest updates via Windows Update.Also: Microsoft said my PC was 'too old' to run Windows 11 - how I upgraded in 5 minutes anywayIf your PC is not yet compatible, Microsoft says to look out for driver updates via Windows Updates. Once your device is compatible, a \"Shared audio (preview)\" tile should appear in Quick Settings.Microsoft's implementation of the audio-sharing feature builds on the Bluetooth LE Audio connectivity standard, which enables audio sharing between Bluetooth-enabled devices. Bluetooth LE is the architecture that supports Auracast, a feature within Bluetooth LE Audio that enables a single source to broadcast to an unlimited number of nearby audio receivers.Is it Auracast? Microsoft omits the word Auracast from its blog post. While the Auracast protocol supports broadcasting to an unlimited number of nearby audio receivers, Microsoft's hardware implementation limits the number of audio receivers its PCs can broadcast to two. (Limiting the number of audio receivers that PCs can broadcast to is entirely within Microsoft's discretion as a manufacturer, as I learned from the Bluetooth Special Interest Group earlier this year.)Also: What is Bluetooth 6.0? Why the newest audio connectivity standard is worth getting excited aboutMicrosoft's blog post says consumers should look for compatible Bluetooth headphones, earbuds, and hearing aids that advertise LE Audio support. Auracast-supported devices can still support the new Windows Bluetooth LE feature, even though Microsoft doesn't specify it. What else comes with LE Audio on Windows 11?Last year, Microsoft announced that certain Windows 11 PCs will support super wideband (SWB), a Bluetooth LE Audio feature that enhances voice clarity. SWB replaces older, less efficient hands-free profiles within the Classic Bluetooth radio. SWB's sample rate is 32 kHz, ideal for voice chat while gaming and for video calls.Also: I spoke with Bluetooth reps about the future of connected audio, and it's cooler than I expectedOn top of SWB, select Windows 11 PCs support SWB stereo, which uses two audio channels for audio output, creating a more immersive and expansive soundstage for gaming and movie-watching. Both your laptop and headphones, earbuds, or hearing aids must be compatible with LE Audio to experience it. Which Windows PCs support LE Audio?As of February 2026, these Windows 11 PC support Bluetooth LE Audio:Surface Laptop, 13.8-inch and 15-inch* | Qualcomm Snapdragon XSurface Laptop for Business, 13.8 and 15-inch* | Qualcomm Snapdragon XSurface Pro, 13-inch | Qualcomm Snapdragon XSurface Pro for Business, 13-inch | Qualcomm Snapdragon XSurface Laptop, 13-inch | Qualcomm Snapdragon XSurface Laptop for Business, 13-inch | Qualcomm Snapdragon XSurface Pro, 12-inch | Qualcomm Snapdragon XSurface Pro for Business, 12-inch | Qualcomm Snapdragon XSamsung Galaxy Book4 Edge | Qualcomm Snapdragon XAlso: After setting up Windows 11, these 9 steps are non-negotiable for meAccording to Microsoft, these laptops are up next for LE Audio support: Samsung Galaxy Book5 360 | Intel Core Ultra Series 200Samsung Galaxy Book5 Pro | Intel Core Ultra Series 200Samsung Galaxy Book5 Pro 360 | Intel Core Ultra Series 200Featured Want local vibe coding?

Beth Mole – Feb 10, 2026 8:21 pm | 95 Credit: DeFodi Images Credit: DeFodi Images Text settings Story text Size Small Standard Large Width * Standard Wide Links Standard Orange * Subscribers only Learn more Minimize to nav The Food and Drug Administration has refused to review Moderna’s application for an mRNA flu vaccine, the company revealed Tuesday. While the move came as a surprise to the high-profile vaccine maker, it is just the latest hostility toward vaccines—and mRNA vaccines in particular—from an agency overseen by the fervent anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. In his first year in office, Kennedy has already dramatically slashed childhood vaccine recommendations and canceled $500 million in research funding for mRNA vaccines against potential pandemic threats. In a news release late Tuesday, Moderna said it was blindsided by the FDA’s refusal, which the FDA cited as being due to the design of the company’s Phase 3 trial for its mRNA flu vaccine, dubbed mRNA-1010. Specifically, the FDA’s rejection was over the comparator vaccine Moderna used. In the trial, which enrolled nearly 41,000 participants and cost hundreds of millions of dollars, Moderna compared the safety and efficacy of mRNA-1010 to licensed standard-dose influenza vaccines, including Fluarix, made by GlaxoSmithKline. The trial found that mRNA-1010 was superior to the comparators. Moderna said the FDA reviewed and accepted its trial design on at least two occasions (in April 2024 and again in August 2025) before it applied for approval of mRNA-1010. It also noted that Fluarix has been used as a comparator vaccine in previous flu vaccine trials, which tested vaccines that went on to earn approval. But in a letter dated February 3, Vinay Prasad, the FDA’s top vaccine regulator under the Trump administration, informed Moderna that the agency does not consider the trial “adequate and well-controlled” because the comparator vaccine “does not reflect the best-available standard of care.” In its news release, Moderna noted that neither the FDA’s regulation nor its guidance to industry makes any reference to a requirement of the “best-available standard of care” in comparators. “This decision by [the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research], which did not identify any safety or efficacy concerns with our product, does not further our shared goal of enhancing America’s leadership in developing innovative medicines,” Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel said in the release. “It should not be controversial to conduct a comprehensive review of a flu vaccine submission that uses an FDA-approved vaccine as a comparator in a study that was discussed and agreed on with CBER prior to starting.” Moderna said it has requested a meeting with the FDA to understand the basis of the refusal. “We look forward to engaging with CBER to understand the path forward as quickly as possible so that America’s seniors, and those with underlying conditions, continue to have access to American-made innovations.” The company noted that mRNA-1010 has already been accepted for review in the European Union, Canada, and Australia.

    "summary": "Samsung’s 2025 was filled with new foldables, an ultra-thin new form factor and the launch of Google's XR platform. After making some announcements at CES 2026, the company has just announced its first Galaxy Unpacked of the year will take place on February 25, where it is expected to introduce the Galaxy S26 lineup. Official invites have just been shared, but actual information on what devices are arriving then is still unknown. But as usual, we know a lot about what’s expected at Unpacked.\nEngadget will be covering Galaxy Unpacked live, and we'll most likely have hands-on coverage of Samsung's new smartphones soon after they're announced. While we wait for the full details, here's everything we expect Samsung will introduce at the first Galaxy Unpacked event of 2026.\n\n\n\nWhen is Unpacked 2026 taking place?\nAccording to the official invite that Samsung shared on February 10, Unpacked will happen on February 25, 2026 in San Francisco. The keynote will start at 10AM PT (1PM ET) and be livestreamed on Samsung.com, as well as the company’s newsroom and YouTube channel. The announcement on February 10 also said this launch will mark “a new phase in the era of AI as intelligence becomes truly personal and adaptive.” It’s not a lot to go on, since we’ve heard a version of this from various companies over the last few years, but at least we won’t be shocked when we hear more about AI in just about two weeks.\nGalaxy S26, S26+ and S26 Ultra\nSamsung Galaxy S25 Ultra hands-on photo\nPhoto by Sam Rutherford/Engadget\n\nSamsung's restrained approach to updating its phones will likely continue with the Galaxy S26. Based on leaked images of the new lineup, the company is not expected to radically reinvent the look of the Galaxy S26, Galaxy S26+ or Galaxy S26 Ultra, and instead will stick with a similar design to what it used on the Galaxy S25. The phones will have a flat front screen and frame, with rounded corners and cameras housed in a vertical pill-shaped plateau on the back. Unlike Apple's move from the iPhone 16 Pro to the iPhone 17 Pro, the biggest difference here will likely be internal components like the screens, chips and camera sensors Samsung uses.\nQualcomm's new Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 chip is expected to be in all Samsung Galaxy S26 phones, though Korean news site Yonhap News reports Samsung's relatively new Exynos 2600 chip could be used in some phones in the lineup depending on the region, a strategy Samsung has deployed in the past. Either way the new phones should be more performant than the previous generation, and in the case of the models with the Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5, particularly good at on-device AI processing.\n\nI have compiled the most accurate comprehensive parameter comparison of Galaxy S25, S25+ and Galaxy S26、 S26+. Which one do you want to buy? pic.twitter.com/aQpoSvYjOz\n— Ice Universe (@UniverseIce) November 29, 2025\n\nOne notable difference between the Galaxy S26 and the Galaxy S25 could be the phone's screen. The new phone will reportedly feature a 6.3-inch FHD+ display according to specs shared by leaker Ice Universe, which makes it ever so slightly larger than the 6.2-inch display used on the Galaxy S25. The S26 will also allegedly come with 12GB of RAM, either 256GB or 512GB of storage and a slightly larger 4,300mAh battery. Samsung isn't changing the cameras on the entry-level phone, though: leaks suggest it'll feature the same 50-megapixel main camera, 12-megapixel ultrawide, 10-megapixel 3x telephoto and 12-megapixel selfie camera as the previous generation. Changes appear to be even more minor on the Galaxy S26+. Other than the new Snapdragon chip, the phone will reportedly feature the same 6.7-inch FHD+ screen, 4,900mAh battery, 12GB of RAM and the same camera array used on the base Galaxy S26.\nThe difference between the Galaxy S26 Ultra and Galaxy S25 Ultra is reportedly a bit clearer. According to Android Headlines, the new phone's cameras will be slightly more raised, and stand out thanks to a new metallic finish. Samsung may also switch back to using an aluminum frame on the Galaxy S26 Ultra, after using titanium frames on both the Galaxy S24 and S25 Ultras. Most importantly, to make the phone actually support Qi2 rather than only technically work with the standard when a case is attached, rumors suggest Samsung will remove the S Pen digitizer layer in the phone and adopt a new method for accepting stylus input. It's not clear what that new method will actually be, but it could let the Galaxy S26 Ultra more easily work with Qi2 accessories without losing its stylus.\nAndroid Headlines also recently shared what appear to be full image renders of the S26 series, and they generally line up with what has already been rumored, leaked and reported so far. If these pictures are accurate, they give us a clearer look at the camera bump and two color variants of the S26 Ultra.\nFans of magnets may continue to be disappointed by Samsung if the latest rumors are accurate. Despite the launch of the Qi 2 wireless charging standard adding support for convenient magnetic alignment years ago, Samsung has yet to bring that feature to its phones. Though the S-series have the higher speed charging rates that the spec enables,  Nieuwemobiel.nl is reporting that, due to images it received of cases with magnetic rings, the S26 series likely won’t have built-in magnets. Samsung has made these cases to add the magnetic capability to its S-series in the past, and the existence of the images of these accessories lends weight to the idea that the company will continue this approach.\nGalaxy Buds 4\nGalaxy Buds 3 Pro in case.\nEngadget\n\nSamsung released the Galaxy Buds 3 and 3 Pro in 2024, with a major redesign that brought them much more in line with Apple's AirPods. The Galaxy Buds 4 and Buds 4 Pro Samsung is rumored to be announcing soon won't necessarily change that, though they will feature a more compact case and less angular stems, according to leaked images from the Samsung Tips app.\nSupport for head gestures to accept and decline calls, a feature Apple includes on the AirPods Pro 3 and AirPods 4, is also rumored to work on both versions of the new Galaxy Buds. SamMobile reports the Galaxy Buds 4 and 4 Pro may also ship with a new Ultra Wideband chip that will make them easier to find with Google's Find Hub network.\nGalaxy Z Trifold\nYes, the TriFold has a crease, two in fact. But they still don't ruin the experience. \nSam Rutherford for Engadget\n\nSamsung announced the Galaxy Z TriFold in late 2025 without firm details of when the new smartphone-that-folds-into-a-tablet would be available in North America. That info came on January 27, when the company announced the TriFold would be available in the US on January 30, for a whopping $2,900. Considering we’ve already seen the device in person at CES 2026 and people are most likely to have had a chance to look at, if not buy the foldable for themselves by the time Unpacked rolls around, we don’t expect Samsung to spend too much time dwelling on it, if at all.\nGalaxy S26 Edge\nAt just 5.8mm thick, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge is one of the thinnest smartphones ever made. \nSam Rutherford for Engadget\n\nWhen the Galaxy S25 Edge was announced in 2025, it seemed possible that Samsung could replace its \"Plus\" smartphone with a unique form factor, just like Apple has opted to do with the iPhone Air. There have been conflicting reports on the matter, but it seems like Samsung will not be doing that with the Galaxy S26 Edge.\nInstead, the smartphone will reportedly remain another option, much like foldables are for customers not swayed by Samsung's traditional smartphones. The Galaxy S26 Edge is rumored to feature a slightly different design than last year's model, according to Android Headlines, with a large rectangular camera plateau that's reminiscent of Google's Pixel phones, and the raised oval Apple used on the iPhone Air. Beyond that, the phone is also expected to be ever so slightly thinner at 5.5mm than the 5.8mm Galaxy S25 Edge.\nBixby and other AI features\n\n\nSamsung already acts as a first place Google can show off new AI features for Android, but the company is reportedly exploring other AI partnerships, too. In June 2025, Bloomberg reported that Samsung was nearing a deal with Perplexity to integrate its AI-powered search engine across OneUI and its homegrown mobile browser. Perplexity already has a deal with Motorola on its Razr phones, so the only thing that would make a deal with Samsung unusual is the close relationship the company already has with Google.\nThe company also accidentally announced a new version of its Bixby AI assistant, which will likely also be integrated with Perplexity and could serve as an alternative to Google Gemini. Both a new Bixby and a deeper integration with Perplexity seem like natural new software features to show off at Galaxy Unpacked.\nUpdate, January 27 2026, 11:55AM ET: This story has been updated to reflect the latest news around the Galaxy Z TriFold’s price and availability in the US.\nUpdate, January 30 2026, 12:45PM ET: This story has been updated to include the latest leaks on the possible dates for Unpacked 2026.\nUpdate, February 02 2026, 11:30AM ET: This story has been updated to include the latest leaks with full image renders of the S26 trio of devices.\nUpdate, February 03 2026, 11:00AM ET: This story has been updated to include the latest leaks about the possible lack of magnetic support on the S26 series.\nUpdate, February 10 2026, 7:15PM ET: This story has been updated to include the official date of Galaxy Unpacked as Samsung announced it today. The intro was also edited to reflect that detail.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/smartphones/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-2026-everything-were-expecting-from-the-s26-launch-on-february-25-130000524.html?src=rss",

Credit: SpaceX Text settings Story text Size Small Standard Large Width * Standard Wide Links Standard Orange * Subscribers only Learn more Minimize to nav The upgraded Super Heavy booster slated to launch SpaceX’s next Starship flight has completed cryogenic proof testing, clearing a hurdle that resulted in the destruction of the company’s previous booster. SpaceX announced the milestone in a social media post Tuesday: “Cryoproof operations complete for the first time with a Super Heavy V3 booster. This multi-day campaign tested the booster’s redesigned propellant systems and its structural strength.” Ground teams at Starbase, Texas, rolled the 237-foot-tall (72.3-meter) stainless-steel booster out of its factory and transported it a few miles away to Massey’s Test Site last week. The test crew first performed a pressure test on the rocket at ambient temperatures, then loaded super-cold liquid nitrogen into the rocket four times over six days, putting the booster through repeated thermal and pressurization cycles. The nitrogen is a stand-in for the cryogenic methane and liquid oxygen that will fill the booster’s propellant tanks on launch day. The proof test is notable because it moves engineers closer to launching the first test flight of an upgraded version of SpaceX’s mega-rocket named Starship V3 or Block 3. SpaceX launched the previous version, Starship V2, five times last year, but the first three test flights failed. The last two flights achieved SpaceX’s goals, and the company moved on to V3. Better results this time The Super Heavy booster originally assigned to the first Starship V3 test flight failed during a pressure test in November. The rocket’s liquid oxygen tank ruptured under pressure, and SpaceX scrapped the booster and moved on to the next in line—Booster 19. This Super Heavy vehicle appears have sailed through stress testing, and SpaceX returned the booster to the factory early Monday. There, technicians will mount 33 Raptor engines to the bottom of the rocket and install the booster’s grid fins. These components are changed from Starship V2. The Raptor engines set to debut on Starship V3 produce more thrust and include changes to improve reliability, according to SpaceX. The Raptor 3s are lighter with plumbing and sensors integrated into the engine’s main structure, eliminating the requirement for self-contained heat shields between the engines at the base of the rocket. The new booster design only uses three grid fins, not four, to provide controllability during descent. The aerosurfaces help stabilize the rocket as it returns to Earth for recovery. The hot-staging ring at the top of the new version of the Super Heavy booster is integrated with the rocket to enable its return to Earth for reuse. The ring was jettisoned and expended on previous Starship flights. Vapors from the boil-off of cryogenic liquid nitrogen surround the 237-foot-tall (72.3-meter) Super Heavy booster.

Credit: SpaceX After receiving its engines and grid fins, the Super Heavy booster will roll out to the launch pad at Starbase. SpaceX’s launch team will fill it with methane and liquid oxygen for a test-firing of its 33 engines. Meanwhile, the first of SpaceX’s upgraded Starship vehicles—essentially the upper stage that flies on top of the Super Heavy booster—will travel to the Massey’s Test Site for its own cryogenic proof test campaign. It is also expected to undergo a static fire test of its six Raptor engines. Assuming that all goes according to plan, SpaceX could be in position to launch the first Starship V3 test flight before the end of March. This will be the 12th full-scale Starship/Super Heavy test flight overall, and the mission will likely follow the same trajectory as previous flights, with Starship arcing halfway around the world from South Texas to a controlled reentry and splashdown in the Indian Ocean. With the upcoming launch, SpaceX is eager to prove Starship V3’s readiness for more ambitious test flights, including an important orbital refueling experiment considered a stepping stone toward sending future Starships to the Moon, Mars, and other distant destinations. NASA officials are closely watching Starship V3’s development because the refueling demonstration is on the critical path for the agency’s Artemis lunar program. A human-rated version of Starship is NASA’s primary option for a Moon lander to ferry astronauts to and from the lunar surface on the Artemis III mission, the next Artemis flight after the Artemis II circumlunar mission that is awaiting liftoff in the coming weeks.

    "summary": "The National Labor Review Board (NLRB) has dropped a case accusing SpaceX of illegally firing eight employees who criticized the company's CEO Elon Musk, The New York Times. The employees were originally fired in 2022 after circulating a letter that referenced reports of Musk's sexual misconduct and called the executive \"a frequent source of distraction and embarrassment.\" The NLRB filed a complaint claiming the firing was illegal in 2024.\nOriginally, SpaceX's opposition to the NLRB's case was that the agency is unconstitutional, The New York Times writes. Complaints about the NLRB's independence and power are not uncommon. Amazon has previously claimed that the board's structure \"violates the separation of powers,\" a critique the company has made even more recently about the Consumer Product Safety Commission. The NLRB dismissed its SpaceX case following an even more unusual line of argument, though: that regulating SpaceX actually fell under the jurisdiction of the National Mediation Board, the government agency that handles mediation in the airline and railway industries.\nBecause the company will technically let anyone book a space flight with it, and it operates under a license from the Federal Aviation Administration, SpaceX's lawyers argue it should be treated like an airline. According to The New York Times, the National Mediation Board issued a decision affirming that logic in January, and not long after, the NLRB dismissed its SpaceX case using the same line of thinking.\nElon Musk and his companies maintain a close relationship with the Trump administration. Musk spent over $250 million to help re-elect President Donald Trump, and he briefly served as a special government employee overseeing budget cuts and layoffs across various government bodies as part of the Department of Government Efficiency. The NLRB gave up its own authority to regulate, rather than it being stripped of funding or employees, but the decision still fits a larger pattern of independent agencies being disempowered during the second Trump administration.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/big-tech/the-nlrb-just-gave-up-on-spacex-workers-who-claim-they-were-illegally-fired-215332847.html?src=rss",

Option A in particular would be a huge change, as more than 695,000 links to Archive.today are used across 400,000 or so Wikipedia pages. Archive.today, also known as Archive.is, is a website that saves snapshots of webpages and is commonly used to bypass news paywalls. “Archive.today uses advanced scraping methods, and is generally considered more reliable than the Internet Archive,” the Wikipedia request for comment said. “Due to concerns about botnets, linkspamming, and how the site is run, the community decided to blacklist it in 2013. In 2016, the decision was overturned, and archive.today was removed from the spam blacklist.” Discussion among editors has been ongoing since February 7. “Wikipedia’s need for verifiable citations is absolutely not more important than the security of users,” one editor in favor of blacklisting wrote. “We need verifiable citations so that we can maintain readers’ trust, however, in order to be trustworthy our references also have to be safe to access.” Archive would be hard to replace On the other side, an editor who supported Option C wrote that “Archive.today contains a vast amount of archives available nowhere else. Not on Wayback Machine, nowhere. It is the second largest archive provider across all Wikimedia sites. Removal/blockage of this site will be disruptive daily for thousands of editors and readers. It will result in a huge proliferation of {{dead link}} tags that will never be resolved.” Several posts mentioned an ongoing FBI case that could eventually make the Archive.today links useless anyway. Some said it would be better to act now than to have Option A forced on them later without a backup plan. One editor supported starting with Option B and eventually shifting to Option A with “the proper end goal being the WMF [Wikimedia Foundation] supporting some sort of archive system, whether their own original or directly supporting the Internet Archive’s work so it can be done more systematically.” Some discussion centered on copyright infringement, given that Archive.today publishes copies of many copyrighted articles. “On the general problem of linking to copyright infringement: perhaps the Wikimedia Foundation can work on ways to establish legally licensed archives of major paywalled sites, in partnership with archives such as the Internet Archive,” one editor wrote. “It would be challenging given the business model of those sites, but maybe a workable compromise can be established that manages how many Wikipedia editors [have] access at a given time.” Malicious code in CAPTCHA page The DDoS attack being discussed by Wikipedia editors was targeted at the Gyrovague blog written by Jani Patokallio. Last month, “the maintainers of Archive.today injected malicious code in order to perform a distributed denial of service attack against a person they were in dispute with,” the Wikipedia request for comment says. “Every time a user encounters the CAPTCHA page, their Internet connection is used to attack a certain individual’s blog.” The trustworthiness of Archive.today was discussed in light of evidence that the site’s founder threatened to create “a new category of AI porn” in retaliation against the blogger. The AI porn threat was mentioned by several editors. “I echo others [that Option] A is looking like something we’ll have to do eventually, anyways, and at least this way we have a chance to do it on our terms,” one editor wrote. “I hate to break it to you, but even if the FBI thing goes nowhere, a website whose operator apparently threatens to create AI porn in retaliation against enemies, using their names, isn’t a trustworthy mirror, and isn’t going to remain one.” One editor reported being “miserable” about supporting Option A, “but we cannot permit websites to rope our readers into being part of DDoS attacks.” Moreover, “The fact is that most of the archive.today links on Wikipedia are not an attempt to save URLs that have now gone dead that the Internet Archive cannot handle, but efforts to bypass paywalls, which is convenient, but illegal. It’s strange that we accept links to archive.today for this purpose but don’t accept the same for Anna’s Archive or Sci-Hub,” the editor wrote. Patokallio told us in an email today, “it’s true that there simply are no alternatives to archive.today for many sources that archive.org does not/cannot cover,” and that he hopes the Wikipedia request for comment “leads to the Wikimedia Foundation creating one as suggested by multiple commenters in the thread.” The Wikimedia Foundation, the nonprofit that hosts Wikipedia, chimed in on the discussion today. “Our view is that the value to verifiability that the site provides must be weighed against the security risks and violation of the trust of the people who click these links,” wrote Eric Mill, head of the foundation’s product safety and integrity group. “We (WMF) encourage the English Wikipedia community to carefully weigh the situation before making a decision on this unusual case.” Noting that “Archive.today’s owner has not been deterred from continuing the ongoing DDoS,” Mill wrote that “the same actions that make archive.today unsafe may also reduce its usefulness for verifying content on Wikipedia. If the owners are willing to abuse their position to further their goals through malicious code, then it also raises questions about the integrity of the archive it hosts.” It’s possible the Wikimedia Foundation will act even if the volunteer editors decide to maintain the status quo. “We know that WMF intervention is a big deal, but we also have not ruled it out, given the seriousness of the security concern for people who click the links that appear across many wikis,” Mill wrote. Blogger tried to uncover founder’s identity The Wikipedia request for comments acknowledged that whether to blacklist would be a difficult decision. There are “significant concerns for readers’ safety, as well as the long-term stability and integrity of the service,” but “a significant amount of people also think that mass-removing links to Archive.today may harm verifiability, and that the service is harder to censor than certain other archiving sites,” it said. An update to the request for comments yesterday indicated that the attack temporarily stopped, but the malicious code had been reactivated. “Please do not visit the archive without blocking network requests to gyrovague.com to avoid being part of the attack!” it said. The code’s first public mention was apparently in a Hacker News thread on January 14, and Patokallio wrote about the DDoS in a February 1 blog post. “Every 300 milliseconds, as long as the CAPTCHA page is open, this makes a request to the search function of my blog using a random string, ensuring the response cannot be cached and thus consumes resources,” he wrote. The Javascript code in the Archive.today CAPTCHA page is as follows: setInterval(function() { fetch(\"https://gyrovague.com/?s=\" + Math.random().toString(36).substring(2, 3 + Math.random() * 8), { referrerPolicy: \"no-referrer\", mode: \"no-cors\" }); }, 300); In August 2023, Patokallio wrote a post attempting to uncover the identity of Archive.today founder “Denis Petrov,” which seems to be an alias. Patokallio wasn’t able to figure out who the founder is but cobbled together various tidbits from Internet searches, including a Stack Exchange post that mentioned another potential alias, “Masha Rabinovich.” Patokallio seemed to be driven by curiosity and was impressed by Archive.today’s work. “It’s a testament to their persistence that [they’ve] managed to keep this up for over 10 years, and I for one will be buying Denis/Masha/whoever a well deserved cup of coffee,” Patokallio’s 2023 post said. In his post this month, Patokallio said his 2023 blog “gathered some 10,000 views and a bit [of] discussion on Hacker News, but didn’t exactly set the blogosphere on fire. And indeed, absolutely nothing happened for the next two years and a bit.” FBI case revives interest in 2023 blog But in October 2025, the FBI sent a subpoena to domain registrar Tucows seeking “subscriber information on [the] customer behind archive.today” in connection with “a federal criminal investigation being conducted by the FBI.” We wrote about the subpoena, and our story included a link to Patokallio’s 2023 blog post in a sentence that said, “There are several indications that the [Archive.today] founder is from Russia.” In an email to Ars, Patokallio told us that the DDoS attack “appears to be because you kindly mentioned my blog in your Nov 8, 2025 story.” Patokallio added that he is “as mystified by this as you probably are.” Articles about the subpoena by The Verge and Heise Online also linked to Patokallio’s 2023 blog post. We emailed Archive.today’s webmaster address today to ask for comment on the Wikipedia discussion. We received an email reply that said, “Ok, but first remove the paragraph with gyrovague excerpt from your previous article.” On January 8, 2026, Patokallio’s hosting company, Automattic, notified him that it received a GDPR [General Data Protection Regulation] complaint from a “Nora Puchreiner” alleging that the 2023 post “contains extensive personal data… presented in a narrative that is defamatory in tone and context.” Patokallio said that after he submitted a rebuttal, “Automattic sided with me and left the post up.” Patokallio said he also “received a politely worded email from archive.today’s webmaster asking me to take down the post for a few months” on January 10. The email was classified as spam by Gmail, and he didn’t see it until five days later, he said. In the meantime, the DDoS started. Patokallio said he replied to the webmaster’s email on January 15 and again on January 20 but didn’t hear back. He tried a third time on January 25, saying he would not take down the blog post but offered to “change some wording that you feel is being misrepresented.” Emails threatened AI porn and other scams Patokallio posted what he called a lightly redacted copy of the resulting email thread. The first email from the Archive.today webmaster said, “I do not mind the post, but the issue is: journos from mainstream media (Heise, Verge, etc) cherry-pick just a couple of words from your blog, and then construct very different narratives having your post the only citable source; then they cite each other and produce a shitty result to present for a wide audience.” In a later email, “Nora Puchreiner” wrote, “I do not care on your blog and its content. I just need the links from Heise and other media to be 404.” One message threatened to investigate “your Nazi grandfather” and “vibecode a gyrovague.gay dating app.” Another threatened to create a public association between Patokallio’s name and AI porn. A Tumblr blog post apparently written by the Archive.today founder seems to generally confirm the emails’ veracity, but says the original version threatened to create “a patokallio.gay dating app,” not “a gyrovague.gay dating app.” The Tumblr blog has several other recent posts criticizing Patokallio and accusing him of hiding his real name. However, the Gyrovague blog shows Patokallio’s name in a sidebar and discloses that he works for Google in Sydney, Australia, while stating that the blog posts contain only his personal views. In one email, Patokallio included a link to Wikipedia’s page on the Streisand effect, a name for situations in which people seeking to suppress access to information instead draw more public attention to the information they want hidden. The Archive.today site maintainer apparently viewed this as a threat. “And threatening me with Streisand… having such a noble and rare name, which in retaliation could be used for the name of a scam project or become a byword for a new category of AI porn… are you serious?” the email said. Patokallio responded, “No, you’re Streisanding yourself: the DDOS has already drawn more attention to my blog post than it had gotten in the last two years, with zero action on my side.” A subsequent reply in the email thread contained the “Nazi grandfather” and “gay dating app” threats. Patokallio wrote that after these emails, it didn’t seem worthwhile to continue the discussion. “At this point it was pretty clear the conversation had run its course, so here we are,” Patokallio wrote in his February 1 blog post. “And for the record, my long-dead grandfather served in an anti-aircraft unit of the Finnish Army during WW2, defending against the attacks of the Soviet Union. Perhaps this is enough to qualify as a ‘Nazi’ in Russia these days.” While the outcome at Wikipedia is not yet settled, Patokallio wrote that the DDoS attack didn’t cause him any real harm. The Archive.today maintainer apparently intended to make Patokallio’s hosting costs more expensive, but “I have a flat fee plan, meaning this has cost me exactly zero dollars,” he wrote.

Itch.io is hosting a bundle to help raise money for the Immigrant Law Center of Minnesota, which was organized by charity creator Jes Wade.\nThe No ICE in Minnesota bundle includes nearly 1,300 video games and tabletop games and costs just $10, though those with deep pockets can certainly donate more than that. It has a goal of $100,000, which it certainly is on pace to meet.\n\n\nThere are some nifty titles here, particularly for those interested in indie puzzle games and life sims. The standout is likely the stellar puzzler Baba Is You, which won the Game Designers Award at the Tokyo Games Show in 2020. This is a game that has to be played to be understood, as players are given the opportunity to change the rules to find novel solutions to complex puzzles. It's very good.\nThe bundle includes the life simulation game Calico, which involves players running a cat cafe on a magical island. The art style is gorgeous and the gameplay is relaxing. Also, calico cats are awesome.\nOther titles include the bee-collecting sim Apico, the musical sci-fi adventure Periphery Synthetic and the space-based roguelike Hyperspace Dogfights. Scroll through the list to see if anything else strikes your interest, but mark out some time on the calendar first. Scrolling through nearly 1,300 games can take a while.\nThe Immigrant Law Center of Minnesota is a nonprofit that provides free representation to low-income immigrants and refugees. The organization also provides support for those who have witnessed violent attacks and advocates for public policies which \"respect the universal human rights of immigrants.\"\n\nI live in Minneapolis. ICE is still here in full force, despite the media moving on to shinier objects. We really do need all the help we can get. The long-term presence of these masked, armed agents is really starting to destroy the local economy and many people are quite literally trapped indoors. To say morale is low would be an understatement. Schools are still being raided and people are still being brutally beaten. American citizens are still being arrested for dubious reasons. This is all happening after the killings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti.\nThat's why these fundraising bundles on Itch have become so important. They really do shine a light on important topics. This is organizer Jes Wade's second ICE-related bundle, with a former focusing on California relief efforts. There have also been bundles to help raise money for the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund and Community Bail Fund and to raise cash for charities working in Ukraine.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/this-itchio-bundle-to-help-minnesota-includes-over-1200-games-and-costs-just-10-190643987.html?src=rss",

In a post on social media, Wu expressed warm feelings for his time at xAI, but said it was “time for my next chapter.” The current era is one where “a small team armed with AIs can move mountains and redefine what’s possible,” he wrote. The mention of what “a small team” can do could hint at a potential reason for Wu’s departure. xAI reportedly had 1,200 employees as of March 2025, a number that included AI engineers and those focused more on the X social network. That number also included 900 employees that served solely as “AI tutors,” though roughly 500 of those were reportedly laid off in September. Wu’s departure comes just months after fellow xAI co-founder Igor Babuschkin departed the company in August to start his own AI safety-focused venture capital firm. Co-founders Kyle Kosic and Christian Szegedy also departed the company since its 2023 founding, and co-founder Greg Yang stepped back from the company last month amid complications from chronic Lyme disease. Other recent high-profile xAI departures include general counsel Robert Keele, communications executives Dave Heinzinger and John Stoll, head of product engineering Haofei Wang, and CFO Mike Liberatore, who left for a role at OpenAI after just 102 days of what he called “120+ hour weeks.” A different company Wu leaves a company that is in a very different place than it was when he helped create it in 2023. His departure comes just days after CEO Elon Musk merged xAI with SpaceX, a move Musk says will allow for orbiting data centers and, eventually, “scaling to make a sentient sun to understand the Universe and extend the light of consciousness to the stars!” But some see the move as more of a financial engineering play, combining xAI’s nearly $1 billion a year in losses and SpaceX’s roughly $8 billion in annual profits into a single, more IPO-ready entity. Musk previously rolled social media network X (formerly Twitter) into a unified entity with xAI back in March. At the time of the deal, X was valued at $33 billion, 25 percent less than Musk paid for the social network in 2022. xAI has faced a fresh wave of criticism in recent months over Grok’s willingness to generate sexualized images of minors. That has led to an investigation by California’s attorney general and a police raid of the company’s Paris offices.

Credit: Getty | Nurphoto Text settings Story text Size Small Standard Large Width * Standard Wide Links Standard Orange * Subscribers only Learn more Minimize to nav The National Cancer Institute is using federal funds to study whether cancer can be cured by ivermectin, a cheap, off-patent anti-parasitic and deworming drug that fringe medical groups falsely claimed could treat COVID-19 during the pandemic and have since touted as a cure-all. Large, high-quality clinical trials have resoundingly concluded that ivermectin is not effective against COVID-19. And there is no old or new scientific evidence to support a hypothesis that ivermectin can cure cancer—or justify any such federal expenditure. But, under anti-vaccine Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.—who is otherwise well-known for claiming to have a parasitic worm in his brain—numerous members of the medical fringe are now in powerful federal positions or otherwise hold sway with the administration. During a January 30 event, Anthony Letai, a cancer researcher the Trump administration installed as the director of the NCI in September, said the NCI was pursuing ivermectin. “There are enough reports of it, enough interest in it, that we actually did—ivermectin, in particular—did engage in sort of a better preclinical study of its properties and its ability to kill cancer cells and we’ll probably have those results in a few months. So we are taking it seriously.” The comments were highlighted today in a report from KFF Health News. Ars Technica was also at the event, “Reclaiming Science: The People’s NIH,” which was hosted by the MAHA [Make America Healthy Again] Institute. In the rest of his comments, Letai seemed to make a noticeable effort to temper expectations while also trying to avoid offending any ivermectin believers. “It’s not going to be a cure-all for cancer,” he said. At another point, he said that even if there are signals of anti-cancer properties in the preclinical studies, “I can tell you again, it’s not a really strong signal.” But, he quickly noted, “this doesn’t rule out… individual reports of people having taken it that had a response to their cancer. This doesn’t invalidate their personal experience.” “Ridiculous” KFF noted that among those individual reports is one from Mel Gibson, who said in a January 2025 episode of Joe Rogan’s podcast that a regimen of drugs that includes ivermectin cured stage 4 cancers in three of his friends. The episode has been viewed more than 12 million times. NCI scientists who spoke to KFF under the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation blasted the funding. “I am shocked and appalled,” one said. “We are moving funds away from so much promising research in order to do a preclinical study based on nonscientific ideas. It’s absurd.” Another called the suggestion that the NCI had previously overlooked ivermectin’s potential “ridiculous.” “This is not a new idea they came up with,” the NCI scientist said. While the revelation that the NCI is funding research based on fringe anecdotes rather than scientific evidence is spurring backlash, it also raises new questions about Letai, who was otherwise a respected cancer researcher prior to taking the role of NCI director. In an interview with STAT News last month, Letai was asked if there were ethical lines he wouldn’t cross for the administration. He responded: “My job is to progress the mission of the National Cancer Institute to reduce suffering from cancer with the resources that I’m given. If it got to a point where I couldn’t do my job, I would feel required to quit.” Beth Mole Senior Health Reporter Beth Mole Senior Health Reporter Beth is Ars Technica’s Senior Health Reporter.

Andrew Cunningham – Feb 10, 2026 1:04 pm | 73 A PC running Windows 11. Credit: Microsoft A PC running Windows 11. Credit: Microsoft Text settings Story text Size Small Standard Large Width * Standard Wide Links Standard Orange * Subscribers only Learn more Minimize to nav Windows 8 is remembered most for its oddball touchscreen-focused full-screen Start menu, but it also introduced a number of under-the-hood enhancements to Windows. One of those was UEFI Secure Boot, a mechanism for verifying PC bootloaders to ensure that unverified software can’t be loaded at startup. Secure Boot was enabled but technically optional for Windows 8 and Windows 10, but it became a formal system requirement for installing Windows starting with Windows 11 in 2021. Secure Boot has relied on the same security certificates to verify bootloaders since 2011, during the development cycle for Windows 8. But those original certificates are set to expire in June and October of this year, something Microsoft is highlighting in a post today. This certificate expiration date isn’t news—Microsoft and most major PC makers have been talking about it for months or years, and behind-the-scenes work to get the Windows ecosystem ready has been happening for some time. And renewing security certificates is a routine occurrence that most users only notice when something goes wrong. But the downside is that the certificate expiration may cause problems for PCs that don’t pull down the patches before the June 2026 deadline. While these PCs will continue to function, expired certificates can prevent Microsoft from patching newly discovered Secure Boot vulnerabilities and can also keep those PCs from booting and installing newer operating system versions that use the new 2023-era certificates. “If a device does not receive the new Secure Boot certificates before the 2011 certificates expire, the PC will continue to function normally, and existing software will keep running,” writes Nuno Costa, a program manager in Microsoft’s Windows Servicing and Delivery division. “However, the device will enter a degraded security state that limits its ability to receive future boot-level protections. As new boot‐level vulnerabilities are discovered, affected systems become increasingly exposed because they can no longer install new mitigations. Over time, this may also lead to compatibility issues, as newer operating systems, firmware, hardware, or Secure Boot–dependent software may fail to load.” Making sure you’ve got the new certificates For most systems, including older ones that aren’t being actively supported by their manufacturers, Microsoft is relying on Windows Update to provide updated certificates. For fully patched, functioning PCs running supported versions of Windows with Secure Boot enabled, the transition should be seamless, and you may in fact already be using the new certificates without realizing it. This is possible because UEFI-based systems have a small amount of NVRAM that can be used to store variables between boots; generally, Windows and Linux operating systems using LVFS for firmware updates should be able to update any given system’s NVRAM with the new certificates. PCs will only have problems deploying the new certificates if NVRAM is full or fragmented in some way, or if the PC manufacturer is shipping buggy firmware that doesn’t support this kind of update. As detailed on a Dell support page, the easiest way to see if your PC has the new certificates is to run a PowerShell command that checks the certificate stored in the “active db,” which is the one currently used to boot the PC. A screenshot from a Windows 11 PC that is already using the new 2023 Secure Boot certificates to boot (the first command has returned “true”) but which does not have the new certificates baked into its UEFI firmware (the second command has returned “false.”) This is normal behavior for older PCs; for newer PCs, check to see if a BIOS update is available.

Andrew Cunningham If the second command returns “true” it means the new certificates are also baked into your PC’s firmware. Newer systems should have BIOS updates available with the new certificates. Andrew Cunningham To check this, right-click either the PowerShell or Terminal app and run it as an Administrator, and type ([System.Text.Encoding]::ASCII.GetString((Get-SecureBootUEFI db).bytes) -match 'Windows UEFI CA 2023'). If this command returns “true,” then your PC is using the new certificate, and you’re good to go. If it returns “false,” here are some steps to enable Windows Update to install the new certificates for you. Make sure you’re running a supported version of Windows. For Windows 11, that means version 24H2 or 25H2. For Windows 10, you need to enroll the PC in the Extended Security Updates (ESU) program, which consumers can do for free after jumping through a couple of hoops. Make sure Secure Boot is enabled in the BIOS and working properly. To check from within Windows, type Windows + R to open a Run window, type msinfo32, and press Enter. In the msinfo32 app, make sure Secure Boot State is set to “on.” Check to see whether there’s a firmware update available for your PC. These may fix bugs preventing the new certificates from being installed. Especially for older PCs that originally shipped with Windows 8 or Windows 10, it may help to do a factory reset of your Secure Boot keys from within your PC’s BIOS settings. This can help ensure that there is enough free space in your PC’s NVRAM to store the new certificates. If you do this on a system with BitLocker encryption enabled, make sure you have your recovery key handy so you can unlock your drive. The second thing to check is the “default db,” which shows whether the new Secure Boot certificates are baked into your PC’s firmware. If they are, even resetting Secure Boot settings to the defaults in your PC’s BIOS will still allow you to boot operating systems that use the new certificates. To check this, open PowerShell or Terminal again and type ([System.Text.Encoding]::ASCII.GetString((Get-SecureBootUEFI dbdefault).bytes) -match 'Windows UEFI CA 2023'). If this command returns “true,” your system is running an updated BIOS with the new Secure Boot certificates built in. Older PCs and systems without a BIOS update installed will return “false” here. Microsoft’s Costa says that “many newer PCs built since 2024, and almost all the devices shipped in 2025, already include the certificates” and won’t need to be updated at all. And PCs several years older than that may be able to get the certificates via a BIOS update. In the US, Dell, HP, Lenovo, and Microsoft all have lists of specific systems and firmware versions, while Asus provides more general information about how to get the new certificates via Windows Update, the MyAsus app, or the Asus website. The oldest of the PCs listed generally date back to 2019 or 2020. If your PC shipped with Windows 11 out of the box, there should be a BIOS update with the new certificates available, though that may not be true of every system that meets the requirements for upgrading to Windows 11. Microsoft encourages home users who can’t install the new certificates to use its customer support services for help. Detailed documentation is also available for IT shops and other large organizations that manage their own updates. “The Secure Boot certificate update marks a generational refresh of the trust foundation that modern PCs rely on at startup,” writes Costa. “By renewing these certificates, the Windows ecosystem is ensuring that future innovations in hardware, firmware, and operating systems can continue to build on a secure, industry‐aligned boot process.” Andrew Cunningham Senior Technology Reporter Andrew Cunningham Senior Technology Reporter Andrew is a Senior Technology Reporter at Ars Technica, with a focus on consumer tech including computer hardware and in-depth reviews of operating systems like Windows and macOS.

Microsoft just announced that it will be refreshing those certificates, which were originally introduced when Secure Boot debuted in 2011, as a security precaution. Secure Boot was a way for Microsoft to protect systems from running unsigned and potentially malicious code before Windows launched. It went on to be an installation requirement for Windows 11, as well as anti-cheat software used in Valorant, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6/7 and Battlefield 6.  \nWithout the new Secure Boot certificates, Microsoft says your system will still function normally, but it will enter \"a degraded security state that limits its ability to receive future boot-level protections.\" Basically, you won't be protected from malware and viruses targeting vulnerabilities in older versions of Windows. As expected, Microsoft also notes that unsupported versions of Windows won't be receiving the new Secure Boot certificates. They're only coming to Windows 11 systems, as well as Windows 10 PCs subscribed to Microsoft's Extended Security Updates.\nMicrosoft says many users will be able to pick up the updated Secure Boot certificates by visiting Windows Update, but a few may need additional firmware updates from their system (or motherboard’s) OEM. You’ll also be able to track the status of your security certificates in the Windows Security app in the “coming months.”\n\"As cryptographic security evolves, certificates and keys must be periodically refreshed to maintain strong protection,\" Nuno Costa, Partner Director of Windows Servicing and Delivery, wrote in a blog post today. \"Retiring old certificates and introducing new ones is a standard industry practice that helps prevent aging credentials from becoming a weak point and keeps platforms aligned with modern security expectations.\"\nCosta says Microsoft has been working with OEMs like Dell and HP to ensure a smooth transition to the new Secure Boot certificates. Many new systems built in 2024 already have the updated certs, while \"almost all\" devices shipped last year have them as well.

There are people on the Internet who want to know all about you! Unfortunately, they don’t have the best of intentions, but Google has some handy tools to address that, and they’ve gotten an upgrade today. The “Results About You” tool can now detect and remove more of your personal information. Plus, the tool for removing non-consensual explicit imagery (NCEI) is faster to use. All you have to do is tell Google your personal details first—that seems safe, right? With today’s upgrade, Results About You gains the ability to find and remove pages that include ID numbers like your passport, driver’s license, and Social Security. You can access the option to add these to Google’s ongoing scans from the settings in Results About You. Just click in the ID numbers section to enable detection. Naturally, Google has to know what it’s looking for to remove it. So you need to provide at least part of those numbers. Google asks for the full driver’s license number, which is fine, as it’s not as sensitive. For your passport and SSN, you only need the last four digits, which is enough for Google to find the full numbers on webpages. ID number results detected. ID number results detected. The NCEI tool is geared toward hiding real, explicit images as well as deepfakes and other types of artificial sexualized content. This kind of content is rampant on the Internet right now due to the rapid rise of AI. What used to require Photoshop skills is now just a prompt away, and some AI platforms hardly do anything to prevent it. Google has made this tool easier to access and faster to report images. You can access it from the three-dot menu on any image that appears in Google’s search results. Just select “remove result” and “It shows a sexual image of me” to begin the removal process. Google will ask if it’s a real image or a deepfake. The company has added the option to add multiple images to a single request, which could save a lot of time if someone is using AI to churn out such content. Sanitizing scans for safer search Neither Results About You nor the NCEI tool works instantly, and they can’t actually remove content from the Internet. But if Google approves the removal request, the content won’t appear in its search results, which is almost as good as not appearing on the Internet as far as most people are concerned. Remnoving explicit images in Google search. Remnoving explicit images in Google search. After adding data to Results About You, Google intermittently scans for that data and will email you alerts so you can quickly remove results. That’s now an option for the NCII tool, too. If you enable it, Google’s system can monitor for new instances of the offending images. Google says it will “proactively filter out” these explicit results for you. This data will be integrated with the Results About You hub so you can see how often they appear. The ID-number scanning is live in Results About You today. Meanwhile, the updated NCEI reporting will be available in the coming days. It will be available in “most countries” and will expand to more over time.

First announced back in November, the latest Windows handheld in Ayaneo’s Next lineup is now up for pre-order, with a spec sheet that makes some of its rivals look modest.\nIf you missed the announcement at the end of last year, the Next 2 is packing a 9-inch OLED display with a 2,400 x 1,504 resolution and a maximum refresh rate of 165Hz (adjustable down to 60Hz). The Next 2 is powered by an AMD Ryzen AI Max+ 395 chip and has a massive 115Mh battery under the hood.\n\nTo put all of that into perspective, the Next 2’s display is more than 1.5 inches larger than the Steam Deck OLED’s, and goes bigger than even the Lenovo Legion Go 2’s 8.8-inch panel. Its battery is the largest of the three by some margin too, and according to Ars Technica it weighs in at around 3.14 pounds (around 1424g), making it more than twice as heavy as the very heavy Xbox ROG Ally X. Get those wrists to the gym if you’re considering picking one of these up.\nAyaneo is ticking all the boxes where inputs are concerned too. Its latest handheld has dual touchpads (a feature ASUS left out on the ROG Xbox Ally X), Hall Effect sticks, an 8-way D-Pad and four customizable rear buttons.\nAll of this tech inevitably comes at a high price, with the entry-level model that ships with 32GB of RAM and 1TB of storage coming in at $1,999, or $1,799 if you take advantage of early bird pricing.

    "summary": "A US judicial body has revised an internal document to remove climate research. The Reference Manual on Scientific Evidence is a document used by judges when they have to oversee cases involving complex scientific matters. The climate science chapter has now been deleted, so they'll be on their own with climate-related cases.\nThis move came after a group of Republican state attorneys wrote a letter to complain about the chapter on climate change. The language in the document, which was authored by researchers from Columbia University, suggests that climate change is driven by the actions of humans. This was a no-go to those state attorneys, despite being an established fact.\n\n\"Nothing is 'independent' or 'impartial' in issuing a document on behalf of America’s judges declaring that only one preferred view is 'within the boundaries of scientifically sound knowledge,'\" the letter states. It's worth noting that the document is nearly 2,000 pages long and declares preferred views on numerous subjects, though the state attorneys only have an issue with the one.\nThe Republicans also complained that the report called the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change an \"authoritative science body.\" The grounds for this complaint seem to derive from a short paper from a Canadian conservative think tank.\n\nUS court agency pulls climate change from science advisory document https://t.co/2ornJlJN1X\n— Ars Technica (@arstechnica) February 10, 2026\nThe letter's authors would not settle for any revisions, according to a report by Ars Technica.

They had better break out some correction tape. The full text of the now-deleted chapter has been posted by RealClimate, if you want to give it a gander.\n\nMore than 99.9 percent of peer-reviewed scientific papers agree that climate change is real and caused by humans.

The studio behind Until Dawn and The Quarry revealed the news with the help of a fresh trailer for the sci-fi survival horror game.\nThe story focuses on the crew of a spaceship that has crash landed onto another world. The survivors have to contend with an alien lifeform that's hunting them and can mimic its prey (no prizes for guessing that Supermassive took inspiration from The Thing here). If these astronauts want to stay alive, though, they'll put the lives of everyone on a dying Earth at risk.\nAs with Supermassive's previous games, Directive 8020 is largely driven by the narrative choices players make at key moments, such as whether to save a crewmate and put the character you're currently controlling at risk, or to abandon them. You might also have to pick between two seemingly identical versions of the same person and let one of them back into the crew. The game has segments in which you'll have to fight or stealthily avoid enemies as well.\nThis time around, Supermassive is introducing a feature called Turning Points, through which you can go back to previous decisions and opt for another path (perhaps to see different endings more easily, keep certain characters alive or make sure you get all the achievements or trophies). A permadeath mode does away with that option for a more traditional survival horror experience. \nYou can go it alone or get some friends to join you for five-player local co-op action — the studio's games have long been good fodder for pass-the-controller couch co-op. Supermassive will add online multiplayer support down the line.\nThe developer originally planned to release Directive 8020 in October 2025.

    "summary": "Numerous major social platforms including Meta, YouTube, TikTok and Snap say they will submit to a new external grading process that scores social platforms on how well they protect adolescent mental health. The program comes from the Mental Health Coalition’s Safe Online Standards (SOS) initiative, which comprises about two dozen standards covering areas like platform policy, functionality, governance and transparency, content oversight and more. The SOS initiative is led by Dr. Dan Reidenberg, Managing Director of the National Council for Suicide Prevention.\nIn announcing these companies' participation, the Mental Health Coalition writes \"SOS establishes clear, user-informed data for how social media, gaming, and digital platforms design products, protect users ages 13–19, and address exposure to suicide and self-harm content. Participating companies will voluntarily submit documentation on their policies, tools, and product features, which will be evaluated by an independent panel of global experts.\"\n\nAfter evaluation, the platforms will be given one of three ratings. The highest achievable safety rating is \"use carefully,\" which comes with a blue badge that compliant platforms can display. Despite being the highest rating, the requirements seem fairly run-of-the-mill. The description includes things like \"reporting tools are accessible and easy to use,\" and \"privacy, default and safety functions are clear and easy to set for parents.\" As for what actions the standards ask of the companies being rated, the \"use carefully\" rating says \"platforms and filters help reduce exposure to harmful or inappropriate content.\"\nThe other ratings include \"partial protection\" which is described in part as \"some safety tools exist on the platforms, but can be hard to find or use,\" and \"does not meet standards\" which would be given if \"filters and content moderation do not reliably block harmful or unsafe content.\"\nThe Mental Health Coalition, founded in 2020, has mentioned Facebook and Meta as partners since the early days of the organization. In 2021 the organization said it would bring together \"leading mental health experts partner with Facebook and Instagram to destigmatize mental health and connect people to resources\" during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn 2022 the nonprofit published a case study with \"support from Meta\" that found \"mental health content on social media can reduce stigma while increasing individuals’ likelihood to seek resources, therefore positively impacting mental health.\"\nIn 2024, the MHC \"in partnership with Meta\" launched a campaign called the Time Well Spent Challenge. In it, the group urged parents to have “meaningful conversations” with teens about “healthy” social media use, focusing less on whether teens should be on these apps at all and more on keeping them on-platform in a “time well spent” way, from reduced screen time to “using social media for good” and reviewing their feeds together.\nThat same year it partnered with Meta again to establish \"Thrive,\" a program that allows tech companies to share data regarding materials that violate self-harm or suicide content guidelines. The Mental Health Coalition lists Meta as a \"creative partner\" on its website.\nLast year it was alleged that Meta buried internal data showing the ill effects of its products on users' mental health. The internal research, dubbed \"Project Mercury,\" began in 2020. Since then the company has introduced some bare-minimum attempts at addressing mental health concerns, such as Instagram teen accounts. Meta is now on trial in California facing allegations over child harm from addictive products, the first in a series of upcoming lawsuits against the social media giant.\nOther companies participating in the rating program include Roblox, which has recently faced stiff accusations over the wellbeing of children on the platform, and Discord which has beefed up its age-verification processes in response to its own serious child endangerment concerns.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/meta-tiktok-and-snap-are-participating-in-an-online-safety-ratings-system-162921333.html?src=rss",

But the van is an unseen hero that keeps the world moving, delivering packages all over the country and transporting food from farm to stores. They haven’t changed much in decades, though. A van is generally a big box with a gas or diesel engine (depending on where you are in the world), and that’s… kinda it, bar a dent or two in the bodywork. Kia’s engineers, riding high on the success of their recent electric vehicles, took notice and did some new things with the PV5, the company’s first electric van. You can spec your PV5 in a number of configurations, and the company already has conversion partners lined up to turn them into just about anything. Of course, camper converters are eyeing them as well, eager to create electric “vanlife” setups. Off the shelf, you can choose between a PV5 Passenger for moving people, a PV5 Cargo for moving things, a PV5 Crew for moving things and people, and a PV5 Chassis Cab to do with as you please. Beneath its modular cabin is the Electric Global Modular For Service, which is part of Kia’s rather fancy-sounding “PBV” strategy. “PBV” means “Platform Beyond Vehicle,” a potential hint at where the brand sees itself going. In this case, it can house a range of battery sizes. In profile, pretty much a conventional one-box van shape. Kia In profile, pretty much a conventional one-box van shape.

Kia There’s a passenger version as well. Kia In the UK, where I live, we get a 52 kWh or 71.2 kWh option with either 120 hp (90 kW) or 160 hp (120 kW). Both options generate the same 184 lb-ft (250 Nm). Cargo model ranges go from a city-friendly 184 miles (296 km) to 256 miles (412 km) for the bigger battery option on the WLTP cycle. No matter which you choose, you can zip from 10 to 80 percent state of charge in half an hour on a 150 kW charger. Neither version is lightning quick; you won’t crack 0–62 mph (100 km/h) in less than 10 seconds, but that’s not what the PV5 is all about. Vans are mobile workplaces. They either get you to your destination so you can use tools in the back, or they help transport other people. Rarely, they’re used as campers. During the van’s development, Kia did some smart outsourcing. It knows it can make a good vehicle; it’s been doing that for years. But it isn’t an authority on how businesses use them for specific purposes, so it brought in the right partners—for example, working with Uber to help optimize the van for ride sharing. It also teamed up with Samsung to integrate connectivity tech to help businesses track and manage charging. A van for all trades Note the AC power socket on the wall.

Kia The entry point at the rear is as low as possible. Kia This segment isn’t one that generally appeals to both sides of the work/life fence. Ford’s Transit can serve as a minibus, but in the UK, it’s primarily a commercial vehicle. VW’s ID Buzz can be used commercially as well, but it mostly wants to be a fun EV for big families. The PV5 needs to be both, and you can spec it as either, or a blend of the two. It also needs to avoid looking like a traditional van. Thankfully, Kia’s designers have made it look less like a box on wheels and more like something you’d spot on a futuristic movie set (sadly, it doesn’t hover). Two-tone paint options, a wild light signature, and thoughtfully placed curves keep it from looking like every other van. It’s… cool? If you opt for the cargo-focused version, which is what Ars tested on the UK launch, you get up to 155.4 cubic feet (4,400 L) of load space. It can accommodate 1,742 lbs (790 kg) of cargo with the smaller battery or 1,521 lbs (690 kg) with the larger pack. The load lip is 16.5 inches (420 mm) off the ground, making it much easier to load heavy cargo. Not luxurious, but build quality is solid. Kia Not luxurious, but build quality is solid.

Passengers get plenty of space to put their rolled-up newspapers, fast-food detritus, and other paraphernalia, as well as a pretty massive window to lean out of should the mood take them. The driver gets a hefty 7.5-inch digital instrument binnacle alongside a 12.9-inch infotainment display. Nearly everything is run through that screen, which is sad for those of us who want a return to physical buttons. It’s quick and responsive, but it lacks the haptic feedback that confirms a tap. The infotainment system supports Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, so you don’t have to use it too much if you don’t like it. On the road, delivering a load Even with 600 lbs (272 kg) loaded in the back—Kia wanted us to have a proper experience—the van felt remarkably car-like. The steering is smooth, and it has a delightfully tight turning circle to help navigate small towns and sharp city bends. It felt sure-footed and stable, though the ride was a touch on the jiggly side on all but the smoothest roads. Yes, it’s a van, so don’t expect a buttery-smooth ride, but because everything else is so car-like, you don’t expect quite so agricultural a ride. Nor do you expect the cabin to sound so echo-y. That contrast strikes you from time to time: it’s clearly built to do a job, but it’s also thoughtfully designed. Its touchpoints are designed to withstand heavy use, so while they’re not especially luxurious, they should hold up to the many painty/muddy/gunky hands that will use them. The powertrain is smooth, the ride a bit less so. Credit: Kia The powertrain is smooth, the ride a bit less so. Credit: Kia Its powertrain feels exactly as you’d expect from Kia: silky smooth. It’s not the quickest vehicle in the world, but its torque gets you up to speed briskly enough. Kia’s claimed WLTP figure of 3.8 miles/kWh (16.4 kWh/100 km) wasn’t quite achievable on a chilly day, but winter weather will inevitably knock those numbers down a bit. You can tell the PV5 isn’t the result of a simple “we have a powertrain, so let’s make a van” situation. Real thought has gone into how it will be used, how operators will interact with it, and how to make their lives easier. Ford, VW, Stellantis, and other van makers in Europe should take note. As for America, never say never. In the UK and Europe, the PV5 costs tens of thousands less than VW’s retro microbus, suggesting that a North American PV5 could avoid the sticker shock that slowed VW’s sales, leading VW of America to delay imports for a model year. Kia America hasn’t announced plans to import the PV5 yet, but Car and Driver recently spotted one testing US-specific modifications on roads near its office. 129 Comments"

The second-gen model that Apple just released outpaces the original in every way (aside from the galling lack of a keyring hole, that is). While it's easy enough to replace the battery in both versions of the AirTag, you might not want to have to worry about the device's battery life for a very long time. Enter Elevation Lab's extended battery case for the AirTag, which is currently on sale at Amazon for $16.\n \nThe case usually sells for $23, so that's a 30 percent discount. It's not the first time we've seen this deal, but it's a pretty decent one all the same.\n \n\n \n \nThis is arguably one of the more useful AirTag accessories around for certain use cases. It won't exactly be helpful for an AirTag that you put in a wallet or attach to your keys, as it's too bulky for such a purpose — and it doesn't have a hole for a keyring anyway. Still, if you're looking for an AirTag case that you can place in a suitcase or backpack and not have to touch for years, this could be the ticket.\n \nElevation Lab says that, when you place a couple of AA batteries in the case, it can extend the tracker's battery life to as much as 10 years (the brand recommends using Energizer Ultimate Lithium batteries for best results). The AirTag is slated to run for over a year on its standard CR2032 button cell. \n \nThe case gives the AirTag more protection as well. It's sealed with four screws and it has a IP69 waterproof rating. What's more, it doesn't ostensibly look like an AirTag case, so someone who steals an item with one inside is perhaps less likely to realize that the object they pilfered is being tracked.\n \nThere are some other downsides, though. Since the AirTag is locked inside a case, the sound it emits will be muffled. Elevation Lab says the device's volume will be about two-thirds the level of a case-free AirTag. However, the second-gen AirTag is louder than its predecessor, which should mitigate that issue somewhat.\n \nFollow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/elevation-labs-10-year-extended-battery-case-for-airtag-is-back-on-sale-for-16-151215952.html?src=rss",

The so-called century bond will form part of a debut sterling issuance this week by Google’s parent company, said people familiar with the matter. Alphabet was also selling $20 billion of dollar bonds on Monday and lining up a Swiss franc bond sale, the people said. The dollar portion of the deal was upsized from $15 billion because of strong demand, they added. Century bonds—long-term borrowing at its most extreme—are highly unusual, although a flurry was sold during the period of very low interest rates that followed the financial crisis, including by governments such as Austria and Argentina. The University of Oxford, EDF, and the Wellcome Trust—the most recent in 2018—are the only issuers to have tapped the sterling century market. Such sales are even rarer in the tech sector, with most of the industry’s biggest groups issuing up to 40 years, although IBM sold a 100-year bond in 1996. A banker familiar with Alphabet’s transaction said the company’s multi-currency bond offering is an effort to expand the investor pool given the massive amount of capital needed by Big Tech companies. “There might be a supply-demand imbalance if you were to try to come back to the US dollar market over and over again,” the banker said. Issuing a century bond in the sterling market is more cost-effective than in the dollar market, where the interest rate is higher, the banker added. While a century bond is “highly unusual” for tech companies, it could appeal to buyers such as life insurance companies and pension funds, which have a mandate to buy long-term assets, said Nicholas Elfner, co-head of research at Breckinridge Capital Advisors. Tony Trzcinka, a US-based senior portfolio manager at Impax Asset Management, which purchased Alphabet’s bonds last year, said he skipped Monday’s offering because of insufficient yields and concerns about overexposure to companies with complex financial obligations tied to AI investments. “It wasn’t worth it to swap into new ones,” Trzcinka said. “We’ve been very conscious of our exposure to these hyperscalers and their capex budgets.” Big Tech companies and their suppliers are expected to invest almost $700 billion in AI infrastructure this year and are increasingly turning to the debt markets to finance the giant data center build-out. Alphabet in November sold $17.5 billion of bonds in the US including a 50-year bond—the longest-dated dollar bond sold by a tech group last year—and raised €6.5 billion on European markets. Oracle last week raised $25 billion from a bond sale that attracted more than $125 billion of orders. Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta all increased their capital expenditure plans during their most recent earnings reports, prompting questions about whether they will be able to fund the unprecedented spending spree from their cash flows alone. Last week, Google’s parent company reported annual sales that topped $400 billion for the first time, beating investors’ expectations for revenues and profits in the most recent quarter. It said it planned to spend as much as $185 billion on capex this year, roughly double last year’s total, to capitalize on booming demand for its Gemini AI assistant. Alphabet’s long-term debt jumped to $46.5 billion in 2025, up more than four times the previous year, though it held cash and equivalents of $126.8 billion at the year-end. Investor demand was the strongest on the shortest portion of Monday’s deal, with a three-year offering pricing at only 0.27 percentage points above US Treasuries, versus 0.6 percentage points during initial price discussions, said people familiar with the deal. The longest portion of the offering, a 40-year bond, is expected to yield 0.95 percentage points over US Treasuries, down from 1.2 percentage points during initial talks, the people said. Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, and JPMorgan are the bookrunners on the bond sales across three currencies. All three declined to comment or did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Written by Elyse Betters Picaro, Senior Contributing EditorSenior Contributing Editor Feb. 10, 2026 at 5:56 a.m. PT Maria Diaz/ZDNETFollow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.Did you know Roku has several secret menus you can access with just a few clicks of the remote? They're like easter eggs -- hidden screens that can reveal diagnostic information, advanced toggles, and developer tools you never knew you wanted (or needed).You can do a \"soft\" reset with these menus, see a log of every remote button press since your last power cycle, find out the exact build of Netflix, Disney+, or Peacock you're running, check out your CPU temperature, or run a TV input test or AP speed test. Also: This 30-second fix made my Roku TV run like new again (and why it works)Sure, most of you may be perfectly happy never using these options on your Roku streaming device, but if you consider yourself a bit of a techie, or maybe you just like pressing buttons to see what happens, these secret menus are downright fun to try. How to find Roku's secret menus What you'll need: A Roku device and a Roku remote. If you don't have the physical remote on hand, use the one in the Roku app. 1. Developer settings Press: Home × 3 > Up × 2 > Right > Left > Right > Left > Right The Developer settings menu is where developers can test their apps on a Roku device before launching them. So, if you're a developer, think of this as your personal dev playground. Here, you can enable the Development Application Installer, sideload one test channel, and even manage your rokudev account. To access it, hit Home three times on your remote, press the Up button twice, and then tap Right, Left, Right, Left, Right. Show more Elyse Betters Picaro / ZDNET 2. Network menu Press: Home × 5 > Right > Left > Right > Left > Right The Network menu isn't exactly secret, but Roku still gives you a slick remote shortcut to access it. Also: I changed 6 settings on my Roku TV to give it an instant performance boostNeed your IP and MAC addresses or want to check your internet connection? That's what this screen is for on your Roku. Just tap Home five times on your remote and then Right, Left, Right, Left, Right to get to it instantly. From this screen you can also view or join networks and even toggle a bandwidth-saver mode. Show more Elyse Betters Picaro / ZDNET 3. Wireless secret screen Press: Home × 5 > Up > Down > Up > Down > Up Here's where things truly start to get \"secret\" -- heck, it's even in the name.The Wireless secret screen on your Roku shows information like signal-strength bars, antenna info, glitch rates, and on-device logs. You can run an AP speed test or purge your Wi-Fi settings, too. If your stream keeps stuttering, this should be your first stop. Just press Home five times and then tap Up, Down, Up, Down, Up. Show more Elyse Betters Picaro / ZDNET 4. Reset and update ('Secret screen') Press: Home × 5 > Fast Forward × 3 > Rewind × 2 You can do a factory reset the normal way under Settings. Or you could use a secret menu.Also: The best Roku TVs: Expert tested and recommendedOn your remote, press Home five times, Fast Forward three times, and then Rewind two times. This will get you to the Reset and update menu (also called \"Secret Screen\") that has options for a factory reset and refresh -- including a soft reset. You can also search for firmware and software updates, run USB port tests, and more. Handy if your Roku is acting up -- and you're too impatient to use the regular Settings menu. Show more Elyse Betters Picaro / ZDNET 5. Ads and screenshots ('Secret screen 2') Press: Home × 5 > Up > Right > Down > Left > Up Once upon a time, this menu let you disable screensaver ads entirely. Nowadays, it's more about giving you control over scrollable ads and screenshot output formats. Officially called the \"Secret screen 2\" menu, it has options like cycle image service, cycle screenshot output format, cycle home screen ad banner server, cycle ad channel, etc. To access this screen, tap the Home button on your remote five times, followed Up, Right, Down, Left, Up. Show more Elyse Betters Picaro / ZDNET 6. HDMI secret screen Press: Home × 5 > Down > Left > Up × 3 Want to know which resolutions, refresh rates, and HDR features your Roku device actually supports? Also: Is your Roku TV spying on you? Probably, but here's how to put an end to itThis is the place to go if you want to access all your HDMI settings. In the HDMI menu, you'll also find options to switch inputs or run a TV input test. To access it, press the Home button on your remote, followed by Down, Left, Up, Up, Up. Show more Elyse Betters Picaro / ZDNET 7. Platform secret screen Press: Home × 5 > Fast Forward > Play/Pause > Rewind > Play/Pause > Fast Forward Your Roku displays granular performance data like CPU temperature and voltage, memory usage, connected remotes and battery levels, and your SSID in the Platform menu. Even better, this screen is a hub for additional submenus: RF remote diagnostics, IPv6 settings, and a log of every remote button press since your last power cycle. Intense, right? To get to it, tap the Home button on your remote five times, then Fast Forward, Play/Pause, Rewind, Play/Pause, Fast Forward. Show more Elyse Betters Picaro / ZDNET 8. Channel info menu Press: Home × 3 > Up × 2 > Left > Right > Left > Right > Left Ever wondered which exact build of Netflix, Disney+, or Peacock you're running? Also: Roku vs Fire Stick: Which one is best for your streaming needs?This menu lists every installed channel with version and build-number details. Highlight one and you can uninstall on the spot -- perfect for troubleshooting or when you want to boot a misbehaving app. Show more Elyse Betters Picaro / ZDNET 9. Reboot shortcut Press: Home × 5 > Up > Rewind × 2 > Fast Forward × 2 Want to do a quick restart? Press the Home button five times, then Up, Rewind twice, and Fast Forward two times. No menus, no waiting. Your remote will lock up for a moment, but then your Roku will reboot. Show more FAQ How fast do I need to enter these button sequences? Pretty fast. If you take a moment too long between button presses, your Roku won't bring up the secret menu you're trying to access. If it doesn't work on the first try, just take a second to breathe and try again. Also: How to reset your Roku: 4 easy ways Can I find these Roku menus without pressing button sequences? Some menus are available in Roku's settings -- like the Network menu. But most of them are buried and only accessible by hitting the right button combo, as far as I can tell. Hence why some of the screens even have \"secret\" in their name. I lost my Roku remote. What can I do? Samesies. Luckily, though, Roku has a software remote available in its mobile app. Download and use that instead. Show more Featured Want local vibe coding?

Written by Steven Vaughan-Nichols, Senior Contributing EditorSenior Contributing Editor Feb. 10, 2026 at 5:28 a.m. PT Calvin Chan Wai Meng via Moment / Getty ImagesFollow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google. ZDNET's key takeaways Linux 6.19 is ready for deployment, while 7.0 is now in the works.This release boasts several performance boosts. The single biggest improvement is for clouds.Ring the bells, sound the trumpet, the Linux 6.19 kernel has arrived. Linus Torvalds announced that \"6.19 is out as expected -- just as the US prepares to come to a complete standstill later today, watching the latest batch of televised commercials.\" Because while the big news in Linux circles might be a new Linux release, Torvalds recognizes that for many people, the \"big news [was] some random sporting event.\"American football, what can you do? Getting back to what's really important, Torvalds described the final week of the cycle as uneventful, with no last‑minute surprises. This period of calm allowed the release to land on schedule and immediately open the merge window for the next kernel. Also: This is my favorite Linux distro of all time - and I've tried them allWith 6.19, the 6.x line ends on .19, mirroring the 3.x and 5.x series before the project increments to 4.0, 6.0, and now 7.0. Mind you, Torvalds confirmed that the next kernel after 6.19 will be branded Linux 7.0, not because of any major upgrades, but because \"I'm getting to the point where I'm being confused by large numbers (almost running out of fingers and toes again), so the next kernel is going to be called 7.0.\" What's included in Linux 6.19?What Linux 6.19 brings to the table is initial support for Intel's linear address‑space separation (LASS). This hardware feature is designed to enable operating systems to block side-channel security exploits, such as the infamous Meltdown and Spectre security holes. LASS achieves this block by more strictly isolating kernel and user memory to mitigate speculative execution and privilege‑escalation attacks. The release also adds support for Arm's Memory System Resource Partitioning and Monitoring (MPAM), giving system software more control and visibility over memory and cache usage on high‑end Arm platforms. Also: 5 Linux servers that let you ditch the public cloud and reclaim your privacy - for freeIn addition, the new kernel introduces a new listns() system call that lets userspace enumerate Linux namespaces directly. This capability is expected to be useful for container tooling and orchestration frameworks that need to inspect isolation boundaries. Linux 6.19 further reworks the restartable sequences implementation, a low‑level mechanism used by threading libraries to optimize per‑CPU operations, to improve robustness and performance under contention. For file systems, the popular Ext4 now supports larger block sizes and smarter handling of POSIX Access Control Lists (ACL) checks. This approach reduces unnecessary permission lookups in directories with many files. The net result can be up to 50% improvements in file reads. In real life, though, you're much more likely to see a far more modest speed boost. Also: Why even a US tech giant is launching 'sovereign support' for Europe nowKernel networking code also benefits from a redesigned transmit‑path locking scheme that replaces a busy lock with a lock‑less list in heavy transmission (TX) workloads. In theory, you can achieve a fourfold increase in network throughput. In practice, though, you'll also see that kind of speed boost in AI and machine learning clusters, not in your next World of Warcraft raid. On the desktop side, Linux 6.19 ships significant updates for AMD graphics. These updates include compatibility improvements for older Radeon HD 7000‑era GPUs via the modern AMDGPU driver stack and better Vulkan support through the open‑source RADV driver. Benchmarks from early testers show that some older AMD GPUs can achieve 30% to 40% performance gains on certain workloads compared with previous kernels. So, if you still have 2012 AMD graphics, you're in luck. You'll see a real speed boost. The release also incorporates expanded High Dynamic Range (HDR) support through the DRM color pipeline API. This capability enables hardware‑accelerated high‑dynamic‑range output on supported displays and GPUs. Also: My proven way to speed up Linux when RAM upgrades aren't worth it (and it's free to do)Beyond graphics, Linux 6.19 tightens integration with the latest Intel and AMD processors. This move continues the steady march of enablement work for RISC‑V and other emerging hardware architectures, reflecting the kernel's growing role in heterogeneous data center and embedded deployments. The real improvements in this release are for business and cloud administrators. The most important of these improvements is the Live Update Orchestrator (LUO). LUO is designed to coordinate kernel updates with minimal disruption to running virtual machines (VMs). It works by treating a live update as a controlled reboot into a new kernel. In other words, you can reboot your server while your VMs keep running. Instead of tearing everything down, LUO preserves the state of chosen userspace objects and critical devices, handing that state to the new kernel. While LUO is primarily designed for cloud and virtualization servers, where you want to update the hypervisor kernel without dropping running VMs or losing in‑memory state, it is explicitly workload‑agnostic. LUO can also be used for other high-uptime services. I expect LUO to be adopted quickly by most cloud providers. Linux 6.19 also adds encrypted communication between PCIe devices and VMs. This link strengthens defenses against snooping or tampering on the bus in multi‑tenant environments. Together with the new Intel memory isolation capabilities and Arm MPAM support, these changes underline a release that quietly leans into security and resource control. What comes next with Linux 7.0?Immediately after 6.19's debut, Torvalds opened the merge window for Linux 7.0 and noted that dozens of pull requests were already lined up and ready for review. Some work has already started on GPU drivers, expanded display support for Intel and Qualcomm platforms, broader sensor monitoring (including new Asus motherboard telemetry), and further refinements to virtualization and live‑update paths. Also: 5 of the easiest, quickest Linux distros to install - and I've tried them allDistributions are expected to begin integrating Linux 6.19 into development branches in the coming weeks, with some rolling‑release systems likely to pick it up first as vendors test the new kernel against their hardware stacks and userland tooling. The first Linux distro expected to ship the newest kernel is Fedora Rawhide, the distribution's development branch.

Close Home Home & Office Home Entertainment Speakers These wireless bookshelf speakers deliver gloriously smooth sound for any style of music The SVS Prime Wireless Pro offers rich, immersive sound that audiophiles will appreciate, and it looks great. Written by Jack Wallen, Contributing WriterContributing Writer Feb. 10, 2026 at 4:25 a.m. PT SVS Prime Wireless Pro ZDNET's key takeaways SVS Prime Wireless Pro powered speakers are available for around $899. You won't find a smoother, better-blended sound from an active speaker at this price point. To get the best bass, you should pair these with the SVS SB-1000 Pro subwoofer. View now at SvsoundView now at Best BuyView now at Amazon more buying choices Follow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.Most consumers believe punchy bass and sizzling highs are key to a good speaker. If that sounds like your taste, then you have a lot of options available for you (because a lot of manufacturers cater to booming bass). But the mark of a truly good speaker is the ability to blend the sound in such a way that you hear it as the artist intended. Instead of highlighting the low and high ends, you should aim to get a balance so you can hear all voices, instruments, and ranges coming together to form a perfect union.That's not to say you want a muddy sound (as a lot of low-end speakers will deliver). The goal is to create a sound field that allows each instrument or voice to shine when necessary (such as during a solo or a particularly important passage in a certain vocal range).Also: Update your Echo speakers ASAP for Alexa's most functional upgrade in decades - here's howI've experienced a lot of speakers that punch up certain frequency ranges because, well, that's what's popular. And certain musical genres inadvertently place those demands on manufacturers.But my aural happy place is when a pair of speakers delivers a buttery-smooth blend of sounds that don't force a particular range on me. Instead, I get to hear the music as the artist intended it. For many, such speakers are called \"Studio Monitors\" because they allow listeners to hear the truth in the sound.The SVS Prime Wireless Pro powered speakers delivered that very thing to me. And paired with my SVS SB-1000 Pro subwoofer, everything I threw at the setup was gloriously smooth. Hearing music through these speakers was like coming home. ZDNET Recommends SVS Prime Wireless Pro These speakers deliver some of the smoothest, best-blended sound I've heard at this price point. details View at Best Buy Best bluetooth speaker deals of the week Echo Spot Smart Speaker With Alexa (2024 Release, Black): $50 (save $30) Beats Pill Wireless Portable Bluetooth Speaker (Matte Black): $100 (save $50) Sonos Era 100 Wireless Alexa Enabled Smart Speaker (Black): $169 (save $30) Bang & Olufsen Beosound Explore Portable Bluetooth Speaker (Black): $199 (save $100) Deals are selected by the CNET Group commerce team, and may be unrelated to this article. Classical, choral, rock, prog, metal, classic rock…the genre didn't matter, as these speakers could handle it all.Of course, sound preference is a personal affair, but when you find a pair of speakers that can deliver a neutral sound, without lacking excitement, you know you have something special.Also: The best sound systems you can buy: Expert testedNote: The preset feature is used in combination with the mobile app that you can pair with the speakers. Although I installed the app, I didn't dive too deep into it because I didn't find it necessary.My experienceFirst off, I should mention that I have a unique setup. I listen to both my turntable and PC from the same speakers (I know, bad audiophile). The reason for this setup is that I listen to both while writing. Sometimes, I'll want to hear a piece of music from vinyl, and other times, I'll want to hear something I don't yet have on my medium of choice. And because my office (with cats roaming around) isn't exactly conducive to floor-mount speakers, I tend to go the bookshelf route.My previous speakers included both Aux and Line In inputs, which meant I could plug my Rega P8 turntable into one and my PC into the other.Also: I put away my subwoofer after trying this room-filling soundbar - and it looks greatThe SVS Prime Wireless Pro speakers have a single RCA Line In and a 3.5mm Line In. You can't plug both of those in and expect the speakers to know which device to prioritize. That's when I had to switch my PC to Bluetooth and connect my turntable to the RCA Line In.The only caveat is that my System76 Thelio disconnects the Bluetooth speakers every time the screen locks. So when I log back in, I have to reconnect the speakers via the Bluetooth manager. No big deal.Okay, on to the music. As I said, I ran these speakers through several genres. Here's a representation:Classical - Samuel Barber's Adagio For Strings - By far my favorite piece of classical music, the SVS Prime brought this heartbreaking piece to its fullest life. Every instrument could be picked out of the orchestra, and I was able to close my eyes and just let the smooth sounds wash over me. One very telling moment in this piece is the first movement's climax, where lesser speakers can distort at louder volumes. The SVS Primes handled it without a single crack.Choral - A Choral Christmas - There is no lovelier Christmas album, and this recording came to life with every instrument and voice blending with just enough space and depth to make me feel like I was in the concert hall listening to VOCES8.Classic Rock - Led Zeppelin's Kashmir - This was off the Mothership release, and I've never heard the song with such clarity.Progressive - Rush's Tom Sawyer - This is my go-to for testing speakers, and the SVS Prime gave the song the punch it deserves. Granted, I am using these speakers with the SVS subwoofer, but the kick you get from the very opening of the piece immediately brought a smile to my face. It's charged with power and just as agile as the musicians.Rock/metal - Band-Maid's YOLO - I love this song. From Kanami's near-virtuosity on guitar, Akane's pounding rhythms, Misa's phenomenal bass lines, Miku's rhythm guitar, and Saiki's voice, this song just fills the room with so much sound. And unlike my previous speakers, the song doesn't get lost in a kick-drum-and-throbbing-bass wall. Along with my testing tracks (all played on vinyl), I've spent the past two weeks listening to Christmas music (as I always do this time of year), and every song filled my heart with delight. ZDNET's buying adviceIf your current speakers sound too harsh or muddy, upgrading to a quality pair of active speakers can make a significant difference. After testing, I found the SVS Prime Wireless Pro to offer a well-balanced sound and a refined design, making it a standout choice at this price point. It's even better when you buy one on sale, which happens frequently nowadays.The specsThe specs for the SVS Prime Wireless Pro powered speakers look like this:Frequency response - 42Hz - 25kHz (+/- 3dB)Drivers - 1\" aluminum dome tweeter and 5.25\" mid-bass driverDual Class-D power amps200 watt (50 watt X 4) RMS powerDigital control tweeter-to-woofer crossover (2kHz (12dB/octave slope)2.36\" wide-flared rear-firing portDTS Play-Fi with lossless 192kHz/24-bit via Critical Listening Mode over Wi-FiCD quality for both Apple Airplay 2 and Chromecast for Android phones and devicesBluetooth 5.0 with AAC and aptXSpotify ConnectHDMI audio input supports ARC and eARCLeft/Right RCA input (input impedance 20K)3.5mm Aux input (input impedance 20K)Toslink Optical Input (S/PDIF receiver works at a range up to 96kHz)Ethernet connectivityUSB service portSubwoofer output - 2V max - auto-detecting low pass filter activates low pass at 80HzCabinet dimensions - 11.61\" (H) x 7.09\" (W) x 8.85\" (D)Weight - Active Speaker Weight 12.3 lbs (5.58kg), Passive Speaker Weight: 11.68 lbs (5.3kg)Included remote for switching between inputs, changing volume, and selecting presetsFeatured reviews I spent weeks with Alexa on the Echo Show 11, and it was awesome (until I started fact-checking) Sony LinkBuds Clip vs. Bose QuietComfort Open: This model wins big I replaced my bedroom TV with a $180 Roku projector - and don't regret it I found the Lenovo ThinkPad to rule them all - and its modular RAM changes everything I spent weeks with Alexa on the Echo Show 11, and it was awesome (until I started fact-checking) Sony LinkBuds Clip vs. Bose QuietComfort Open: This model wins big I replaced my bedroom TV with a $180 Roku projector - and don't regret it I found the Lenovo ThinkPad to rule them all - and its modular RAM changes everything Editorial standards Show Comments Log In to Comment Community Guidelines Related Finally, I found a Bluetooth speaker that pumps out loud sound (and looks good doing it) I changed 3 settings on my Sonos soundbar to instantly improve the audio performance How I upgraded my soundbar audio quality for free - and 4 other methods to give it a boost"

Close Home Home & Office Home Entertainment Speakers Finally, I found a Bluetooth speaker that pumps out loud sound (and looks good doing it) The Marshall Woburn 3 is a high-end Bluetooth speaker that both looks and sounds like a professional-grade amp. Written by Prakhar Khanna, Contributing WriterContributing Writer Feb. 10, 2026 at 4:21 a.m. PT Marshall Woburn 3 ZDNET's key takeaways The Woburn 3 is the most expensive home audio speaker from Marshall. It has fantastic sound quality, strong bass, and clear mids. However, the system only supports the SBC codec. $499.99 at Amazon$499.99 at Best Buy$399 at B&H Photo-Video more buying choices Follow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.The Marshall Woburn 3 commands a premium price, and while it's not the best value on specs alone, its rich, powerful sound and iconic design make it a standout for die-hard Marshall fans and audiophiles alike. If you've been considering the brand's flagship Bluetooth speaker, now might be the time to splurge -- discounts are rare, and any price drop makes it a far better deal than paying full retail. ZDNET RECOMMENDS Marshall Woburn 3 One of the latest speakers from the audio company features a stylish design and loud output. details View at Amazon Best bluetooth speaker deals of the week Echo Spot Smart Speaker With Alexa (2024 Release, Black): $50 (save $30) Beats Pill Wireless Portable Bluetooth Speaker (Matte Black): $100 (save $50) Sonos Era 100 Wireless Alexa Enabled Smart Speaker (Black): $169 (save $30) Bang & Olufsen Beosound Explore Portable Bluetooth Speaker (Black): $199 (save $100) Deals are selected by the CNET Group commerce team, and may be unrelated to this article. Timeless look and feel Prakhar Khanna/ZDNETThe Woburn 3 sports the signature Marshall look inspired by the company's old guitar amplifiers. At 7.5kg in weight and 12.5 x 15.8 x 8.0 inches in measurement, it's a big speaker. With its timeless look and feel, the Woburn 3 in Black would blend into any room decor. Also: The best soundbars of 2026: Expert tested and recommendedOn top, you get a faux leather finish with brass control knobs for Volume, Base, and Treble. They're accompanied by a power switch, a playback control slider knob, an aux port, and another button to switch between Bluetooth, aux, RCA, and HDMI inputs. The front is a cloth speaker grille with the company's branding, completing the classy, elegant look. Connectivity options include Bluetooth v5.2, HDMI, RCA, and a 3.5 mm jack. You also get a cavity on the back to make it easier to pick up and move the speaker when needed. Where it lacks in features, it makes up for in soundThe Marshall Woburn 3 isn't as feature-rich as some other speakers in this price range. There's no Wi-Fi or voice assistant support, and you miss out on AAC, AptX, LDAC, and other hi-res capable codecs. Marshall has put a lot of effort into the hardware but has done a poor job by limiting wireless source support. If you can look past it, the speaker does a fantastic job at what it's made for. Also: I put away my subwoofer after trying this room-filling soundbar - and it looks greatThe Woburn 3 features a 90 W Class D amplifier powering a 6-inch woofer, with dual 15 W amplifiers. Two 15W Class D amplifiers drive the two 0.75-inch tweeters. These are all highly capable drivers. Prakhar Khanna/ZDNETI had the treble and bass knobs set to neutral throughout my testing. The speaker delivers strong bass with the woofer's low-end power. It has a bass-forward DSP that delivers detail even at low volumes. You can feel the sub-bass thumps at 30% or higher volume. Go louder, and the bass stays clean and detailed.Also: Your LG TV is getting a big audio performance upgrade for free - including these OLED modelsYou'll enjoy listening to rock, punk, and heavy metal just as much as you do acoustic music. The drums feel headbanging-worthy, and the acoustic strums also sound bright and detailed. The vocals are clear, and the mids are detailed with sparkly highs. However, the higher frequencies tend to distort slightly at high volume. The sound signature is very enjoyable, and the speaker can fill a big room at 70% volume. If the physical controls are out of reach, the Woburn 3 can be paired with the Marshall Bluetooth app to adjust in-app EQ. You can also use the Placement Compensation feature to set the speaker at the best place in your room, and it'll adjust the sound accordingly. To get the most out of your speaker, you just need to answer two basic questions. ZDNET's buying adviceThe Marshall Woburn 3 isn't the best value for money -- it costs more than it offers. The drivers support hi-res codecs, but if you want a speaker for its performance and timeless aesthetic, the Marshall Woburn 3 is a great deal at $515.The big Marshall home speaker delivers strong, clean bass with a rumble, alongside bright highs and detailed mids. It's superb for big rooms. But if you want something smaller from Marshall, the Stanmore 3 is great too. You can get it for around $399, where the missing codec support is still formidable.Featured reviews I spent weeks with Alexa on the Echo Show 11, and it was awesome (until I started fact-checking) Sony LinkBuds Clip vs. Bose QuietComfort Open: This model wins big I replaced my bedroom TV with a $180 Roku projector - and don't regret it I found the Lenovo ThinkPad to rule them all - and its modular RAM changes everything I spent weeks with Alexa on the Echo Show 11, and it was awesome (until I started fact-checking) Sony LinkBuds Clip vs. Bose QuietComfort Open: This model wins big I replaced my bedroom TV with a $180 Roku projector - and don't regret it I found the Lenovo ThinkPad to rule them all - and its modular RAM changes everything Editorial standards Show Comments Log In to Comment Community Guidelines Related This Bluetooth speaker I tested delivers immersive sound at a price that's easy on the wallet I've yet to find a Bluetooth speaker that delivers more powerful bass and clearer mids than this How I upgraded my soundbar audio quality for free - and 4 other methods to give it a boost"

Written by Jack Wallen, Contributing WriterContributing Writer Feb. 10, 2026 at 4:15 a.m. PT Jack Wallen / Elyse Betters Picaro / ZDNETFollow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.I've been using Android since version 1.5, so it's rare for a feature to catch me off guard. You can imagine that when I do come across an unfamiliar Android feature, it's an exciting moment.For more casual (or newer) users of Google's mobile operating system, there are probably several hidden gems waiting to be discovered in Android, and some of these can be handy.Also: How to clear your Android phone cache (and say goodbye to slow performance)I've curated five somewhat hidden Android features that I believe every user should at least know about. Let's dive into those features.1. Share Wi-Fi via QR codeYou may not give this feature a second thought, but allow me to set a scene for you. Say you're having visitors for the holidays and want to grant them access to your Wi-Fi network. Instead of making the password public (so anyone can use it), you could share the Wi-Fi credentials via QR code. Not only does this approach simplify adding another device to the network, but it also does so with a nod to security. Open Settings > 'Network and Internet' > Internet, and tap the network you want to share. At the top of the resulting page, tap Share and verify it's you via biometrics or password/PIN.Also: My secret trick to easily share Wi-Fi passwords with guests (and why I can't go back)A new page will open with a QR code for the selected Wi-Fi network. Present the QR code to whoever you want to scan it with their phone, a process that automatically adds the network to their device. You could also screenshot the QR code, print it out, and make the printout available (so you don't have to hand your phone around for people to scan). Sharing Wi-Fi via QR Code makes the process so much easier. Screenshot by Jack Wallen/ZDNET2. Enable 'Developer options'Android's 'Developer options' menu isn't just for developers. Anyone can enable it and gain access to a host of features, some of which are very handy. With Developer options enabled, you can configure the maximum number of Bluetooth devices allowed to connect to your phone, unlock your bootloader, enable automatic system updates, enable USB debugging, edit the graphics driver settings, force peak refresh rate, and much more. Developer options should be enabled if you want power user-level control over Android. Also: How to factory reset your Android phone without unlocking it firstTo enable the feature, go to Settings > About Phone, scroll to the bottom of the page, and tap 'Build number' seven times. Once you've done that, you'll find 'Developer options' in Settings > System. Tap that entry to reveal the new options. You'll find tons of new configuration options here. Screenshot by Jack Wallen/ZDNET3. Text translationIf you're traveling outside your country, you might need help translating text. Fortunately, Android is quite capable of translating text via the camera app.This is an impressive feature. Let's say you have a menu or some other information you want translated. Unlock your Android phone and tap the Lens icon in the Search bar. Point your camera at what you want to translate and tap the Translate button.Also: 5 habit trackers on Android that can reveal your patterns - and motivate you to changeAndroid will automatically translate the text and display it as an image (almost exactly how it's laid out in the original document). You can then view the translated text, copy it to your computer, take a screenshot, or search for it. You could use this feature for just about any situation where you need text translated automatically.As a bonus, there's also the official Google Translate app, which can listen to voices and translate from one language to another. If you travel to countries where you don't speak the native language, this app should be a must-have. Translating the text from the Howl's Moving Castle soundtrack. On the left is the original, and on the right is the translated text. Screenshot by Jack Wallen/ZDNET4. Use Extend UnlockWhen at home, I don't need to lock my phone because I'm not concerned that someone will grab it and steal my information. Where physical threats to your phone are minimal, consider making access easier by enabling Extend Unlock (which used to be called Smart Lock) and adding your home as a Trusted Place. Also: How to start using the new Linux terminal on your Android deviceTo do this, go to Settings > 'Security & privacy' > 'More security & privacy' > Extend Unlock. You'll be prompted to verify that it's you and then be presented with a description of Extend Unlock. On the next page, you can configure Extend Unlock for on-body detection, trusted places, or trusted devices. Tap 'Trusted places' and, on the resulting page, add a new trusted place. Once you've done that step, whenever you arrive at your trusted place, your phone will be unlocked automatically until you leave that location.Note that this approach can lead to security issues, especially if you have guests in your home. With that in mind, use this feature judiciously. Use Extend Unlock with caution. Screenshot by Jack Wallen/ZDNET5. Set your medical informationAndroid allows you to store important medical information, such as name, height, weight, gender, blood type, date of birth, organ donor status, pregnancy status, medications, address, and medical notes. If you ever need this feature, you'll be glad you took advantage of it. To add your medical information, go to Settings > 'Safety & emergency' > 'Medical information'. On the next page, add whatever information you deem important. There are two caveats to this feature. First, emergency responders need to know about the feature to use it. Second, those same responders would have to be able to unlock your phone to access it. Also: The best SSH clients for Android - including my two favoritesTo get around that issue, tap 'Change setting' at the bottom and, on the resulting page, make the information available, even when your phone is locked, during an emergency call. To access this feature, tap Emergency at the bottom of the dial pad (for the unlock screen) and then tap View Emergency Information. Even with these hurdles, it's an important feature to have available should you need it. Add only the information you deem necessary for medical emergencies. Screenshot by Jack Wallen/ZDNET6. Gboard clipboardYou might not know this fact, but the Android keyboard (Gboard) has some impressive clipboard features. Once enabled, you can copy text and images (holding them on the clipboard for up to an hour before forgetting them), save and edit clips (so you can reuse them later), pin clips (by touching and holding them), and more. Also: I changed 12 settings on my Android phone to dramatically improve battery lifeYou have to enable the Gboard clipboard manually. Otherwise, Android will use the traditional, built-in clipboard. I much prefer the Gboard clipboard because of the extended features. You enable the clipboard by opening the keyboard (from within any app), tapping the clipboard icon, and then tapping the On/Off slider until it's in the On position. The Gboard clipboard is so much better than the default. Screenshot by Jack Wallen/ZDNETFeatured Want local vibe coding?

The Federal Judicial Center has been established by statute as the “research and education agency of the judicial branch of the United States Government.” As part of that role, it prepares documents that can serve as reference material for judges unfamiliar with topics that find their way into the courtroom. Among those projects is the “Reference Manual on Scientific Evidence,” now in its fourth edition. Prepared in collaboration with the National Academies of Science, the document covers the process of science and specific topics that regularly appear before the courts, like statistical techniques, DNA-based identification, and chemical exposures. When initially released in December, the fourth edition included material on climate change prepared by two authors at Columbia University. But a group of attorneys general from Republican-leaning states objected to this content. At the end of January, they sent a letter to the leadership of the Federal Judicial Center outlining their issues. Many of them focus on the text that accepts the reality of human-driven climate change as a fact. “Nothing is ‘independent’ or ‘impartial’ in issuing a document on behalf of America’s judges declaring that only one preferred view is ‘within the boundaries of scientifically sound knowledge,’” the letter complains, while ignoring many topics where the document does exactly that. But the objections are only about one specific area of science: “The Fourth Edition places the judiciary firmly on one side of some of the most hotly disputed questions in current litigation: climate-related science and ‘attribution.’” In short, the state attorneys general object to the document treating facts as facts, as there have been lawsuits that contested them. “Among other things, the Manual states that human activities have ‘unequivocally warmed the climate,’ that it is ‘extremely likely’ human influence drives ocean warming, and that researchers are ‘virtually certain’ about ocean acidification,” their letter states, “treating contested litigation positions as settled fact.” In other words, they’re arguing that, if someone is ignorant enough to start a suit based on ignorance of well-established science, then the Federal Judicial Center should join them in their ignorance. The attorneys general also complain that the report calls the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change an “authoritative science body,” citing a conservative Canadian public policy think tank that disagreed with that assessment. These complaints were mixed in with some more potentially reasonable complaints about how the climate chapter gave specific suggestions on how to legally approach some issues, and assigned significance to one or two recent studies that haven’t yet been validated by follow-on work. But the letter’s authors would not settle for revisions based on a few reasonable complaints; instead, they demand the entire chapter be removed because it accurately reflects the status of climate science. Naturally, the Federal Judicial Center has agreed. We have confirmed that the current version of the document no longer includes a chapter on climate science, even though the foreword by Supreme Court Justice Elana Kagan still mentions it.

Close Home Tech Smartphones Mobile Accessories These Bluetooth trackers beat my AirTags in 2 meaningful ways (and work with Android) Rolling Square's AirCard Pro and AirNotch Pro will do most tracking work while offering useful design features. Written by Adrian Kingsley-Hughes, Senior Contributing EditorSenior Contributing Editor Feb. 10, 2026 at 4:14 a.m. PT Rolling Square AirCard Pro and AirNotch Pro ZDNET's key takeaways Both tags feature super loud 360-degree omnidirectional buzzers Both finder tags are super tough and built to last The tags have features you don't see on AirTags, such as wireless charging and glow-in-the-dark inserts. $18.99 at Amazon I love finder tags and have them on anything and everything I can possibly lose. They've made life so much better -- reducing frustration and eliminating those morning panics over finding my keys and wallet.While the Apple AirTag is undoubtedly the best of the best -- it's the only tag to offer precision finding -- plenty of third-party finder tags offer features that AirTags can't provide.Also: AirTag 2 vs. AirTag 1: I compared both Bluetooth trackers, and the winner is not so obviousOne company hitting it out of the park with finder tags is Rolling Square, whose two latest options are fantastic. First up is the AirCard Pro, a finder tag designed to be slid into a wallet or purse. According to Rolling Square, this is the world's first Bluetooth finder tag with wireless charging, Android and Apple compatibility, and an integrated digital ID feature. ZDNET RECOMMENDS Rolling Square AirCard Pro A finder tag that's compatible with Android and Apple Find My networks. details View at Amazon The tag measures 85.4 x 54 x 2.2 mm/3.4 x 2.2 x 0.09 inches -- thinner than two credit cards -- and weighs only 18 grams / 0.63 ounces. It's also built tough. It's constructed from two nearly unbreakable epoxy-fiberglass sheets that sandwich the electronics in a CNC-machined anodized aluminum frame. Inside this tiny package is a loud buzzer that can be heard almost anywhere. Super thin, yet tough! Adrian Kingsley-Hughes/ZDNET The AirCard Pro features an ultra-flat lithium 220mAh battery that provides 12 months of battery life, whether you're using it with an iPhone or an Android device (the black cards are for Apple's Find My network, and the white cards for Google's Find My Device network). When the battery goes flat, just pop the AirCard Pro on a wireless charger, and it'll be charged up in 90 minutes.Also: How to find out if an AirTag is tracking you - and what to do about itThe laser-etched QR code lets you create a Digital ID to which you can add your contact info, social media links, and any other personal data you want. You can share this ID by getting people to scan the QR code. If the worst happens and you lose your wallet, you can change the message to include information to help you get it back. The omnidirectional speaker is much louder than the speaker on the AirTag. Adrian Kingsley-Hughes/ZDNET Next is the AirNotch Pro, a finder tag for fitting onto keys. Again, this is another world's first for Rolling Square: a Bluetooth finder tag that is Android- and Apple-compatible (again, the black tags are for Apple's Find My network, and the white ones for Google's Find My Device network), with a replaceable battery and 360-degree omnidirectional sound.Also: I created the ultimate Wi-Fi password key with the most unexpected gadget - how it worksThese tags are also built to survive, made of tough ABS plastic, robust CNC-machined anodized aluminum, and custom gaskets -- providing IP68-rated dust- and water-resistance. Everything is held together with a dozen Torx screws.Embedded into the case are ultra-bright photoluminescent glow-in-the-dark inserts that help you find your items day or night -- a fantastic touch. Yes, it has glow-in-the-dark elements for easy finding in low-light conditions. Adrian Kingsley-Hughes/ZDNET The tags measure 54.8 x 27.6 x 10.2 mm/2.2 x 1.1 x 0.4 inches and weigh only 23 grams/0.35 ounces. Inside are two CR2032 replaceable button batteries, which will last 20 months before needing to be replaced. The AirNotch Pro also features two super-loud buzzers that emit omnidirectional 360-degree sound to help you locate your items. ZDNET's buying adviceI do like Rolling Square hardware. Everything the company makes that I've tested has exceeded my expectations (it also makes some excellent charging cables).Also: This smart luggage lock has effectively replaced the AirTag for me when travelingRolling Square products combine great engineering with tough construction; these tags are no exception. I love the handy little features, such as the super-loud buzzer -- Apple really needs a louder buzzer on the AirTags -- and the use of photoluminescent paint.The AirCard Pro and AirNotch Pro are both pricier than the AirTag, but they work on both Apple and Android networks, have more features, and are built to last.

Close Home Tech Services & Software Operating Systems Mobile OS Android Need a rugged Android tablet for your business? I tested one that looks great and lasts all day The Oukitel RT10 tablet is built like a tank yet still delivers a bright, vivid display at a fair price. Written by Jack Wallen, Contributing WriterContributing Writer Feb. 10, 2026 at 4:09 a.m. PT Oukitel RT10 tablet ZDNET's key takeaways The Oukitel RT10 tablet is on sale now for $429. This beefy tablet has respectable performance and unrivaled battery life. If you're looking for something light and delicate, look elsewhere. View now at Oukitel Follow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.For me, Oukitel is synonymous with ruggedness. Every product I've ever been sent from them is an exercise in durability. Just picking up one the brand's tablets or phones makes you realize how light and delicate other brands' devices actually are. The RT10 tablet is no exception. It's thick, heavy, and sturdy, but it's no gimmick. Also: I tested a 33,000mAh Android phone with a built-in projector for a week - here's my verdictYou might think these brawny devices would be a gimmick, but they actually serve an important purpose. Consider this: You take your delicate iPad out into the field (or camping, or anywhere that doesn't offer ideal conditions) and wind up having to carry it around as carefully as you might a newborn baby. ZDNET RECOMMENDS Oukitel RT10 Tablet This heavy-duty tablet can take a beating and continue running for days. details View at Oukitel The RT10 weighs in at a chonky 1255g. To put that into perspective, the 13-inch M4 iPad Pro weighs a scant 523g. Given the RT10 is an 11-inch tablet, the 11-inch version of the same iPad only weighs 444g. The RT10 weighs nearly three times the iPad. Of course, the iPad would shudder if you took it into the conditions the RT10 is built for. My experienceWith the form factor out of the way, let's talk about how I fared with the Oukitel RT10. After unboxing the tablet, I connected Android to my Google account and set up the usual features (fingerprint, etc). As with any Android device, it was incredibly easy.I then went about my usual testing. The first thing I do with tablets and phones is see how responsive the UI is. In the case of the RT10, the Android UI was a bit sluggish. Also: Why I'm recommending Google's Pixel Buds in 2026 (after years of passing on them)That aroused my curiosity. I decided to install a different homescreen launcher. To be specific, I went with O Launcher. Why did I do this? Primarily because O Launcher uses fewer system resources than most, I figured it might solve the tablet's sluggishness.Lo and behold, using O Launcher as my default solved that issue. Now the RT10 runs like an absolute champ.With speed no longer an issue, I put the tablet through the usual paces. Here are my conclusions:Display: It's quite crisp. I'd go so far as to say that this is the best tablet display Oukitel has produced.Sound: The speakers are capable of producing very loud sound. On top of that, it offers a pretty good amount of bass, preventing the sound from being too tinny (like so many tablets). This might be the best-sounding tablet I've tested.Performance: Once I installed O Launcher, the RT10 performed very well. Out of the box, however, it was a little sluggish.Battery: Good grief, the battery just keeps going and going. I set up the tablet and put it away for over a month. When I started it up again, there was still a 94% charge.OS: It's Android 15, but I've got no big gripes there.RAM: Out of the box, you get 16GB. Like all Oukitel devices, you can bump that up with what they call Memory Expansion. In all my time testing Oukitel devices, I've yet to see memory expansion have much impact on performance. This time, however, I noticed a slight bump after enabling the feature.Cameras: I was actually surprised by the quality of the pictures the cameras produced. Even the selfie camera wasn't too shabby. No, they aren't as good as the Pixel cameras, but they can hold their own. The Camera app also doesn't include a horde of AI features, so it's just point-and-click goodness. The Macro camera is pretty good, but don't think you're going to win any awards with it. Me and my goofy mug. Jack Wallen/ZDNETThe big issue some users might have is the weight. The RT10 is as heavy as a tablet can be. What you have to remember, however, is that's part of what makes Oukitel's products so unique. The RT10 is specifically made to thrive in tough conditions. Take this tablet to the beach, on a hike, to a construction site… it doesn't matter because it's got the oomph to stand up to just about anything you can throw at it.Also: The best rugged phones in 2026: Tested by expertsAnother thing I really appreciate about the Oukitel tablets is that most of them ship with a handy (and very sturdy) kickstand. The kickstand has to be attached, and it adds to the weight, but it's very much worth using. Gotta love these beefy kickstands. Jack Wallen/ZDNETYou also get a hand strap you can attach. Both of these accessories are attached by way of screws, so they are rock solid. Lastly, there's a carrying strap you can attach to the kickstand to make carrying the RT10 around easier.ZDNET's buying adviceThe Oukitel line of devices appeals to a certain cross-section of society. If you drive a Ford F150 to work and you come home caked in dirt or construction dust, this tablet is for you. If you're a hiker or camper, ditto. As well, if you want a tablet with an absolutely massive battery, you could do a whole lot worse than the RT10.If, on the other hand, you prefer a tablet that weighs nothing, looks like every other tablet being carried around, and you don't like Android, this tablet is most certainly not for you.Oukitel RT10 tablet specsDisplay: 11-inch IPS FHD+ 1200 x 1920 with a 120Hz refresh rate and 500 nits brightness.Processor: MediaTek Dimensity 7400X (4x 2.6 GHz Cortex-A78 + 4x 2.0 GHz Cortex-A55).Memory & Storage: 12GB LPDDR5 RAM (expandable up to 36GB) and 512GB UFS 3.0 internal storage, with support for up to 2TB expandable storage.Battery: 25,000mAh capacity with 33W fast charging and reverse charging capability.Cameras: 64MP main rear camera (OV64B40), 20MP Sony night vision camera, 5MP macro lens, and 32MP Samsung front camera.Ruggedization: IP68/IP69K water/dust resistance and MIL-STD-810H certification, surviving drops up to 1.5 meters.Connectivity: 5G, Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.4, NFC, and GPS.Audio & Ports: Dual 5W speakers (>130dB), USB-C, and pogo pin connector.OS: Android 15.Industry Version Features: Includes a 2D barcode scanner and a customizable fingerprint module for enterprise useFeatured reviews I spent weeks with Alexa on the Echo Show 11, and it was awesome (until I started fact-checking) Sony LinkBuds Clip vs. Bose QuietComfort Open: This model wins big I replaced my bedroom TV with a $180 Roku projector - and don't regret it I found the Lenovo ThinkPad to rule them all - and its modular RAM changes everything I spent weeks with Alexa on the Echo Show 11, and it was awesome (until I started fact-checking) Sony LinkBuds Clip vs. Bose QuietComfort Open: This model wins big I replaced my bedroom TV with a $180 Roku projector - and don't regret it I found the Lenovo ThinkPad to rule them all - and its modular RAM changes everything Editorial standards Show Comments Log In to Comment Community Guidelines Related We ran battery tests on 9 popular tablets - this model lasted the longest (and other surprise results) I lived with this 25-inch Android tablet for a week - and it went surprisingly well The tablet that replaced my iPad and Kindle got a worthy successor (and it's just as cheap)"

ZDNET's key takeaways If Windows is your preferred operating system, consider these open-source apps.There are numerous open-source apps available for almost any task.These are all free to install and use on Windows.I've been using open-source software for a very long time. In fact, the last time I didn't use open-source software, Bill Clinton was president of the US.Also: This 11-in-1 docking station is the office productivity gadget I didn't know I neededOpen-source software is available for nearly every operating system on the market, from desktops to phones, and I often find open-source apps are superior to their proprietary counterparts. If you're a Windows user, you don't have to remain locked into closed-source software, because there are so many alternatives from which you can choose. Let me introduce you to some of my favorites. 1. LibreOffice LibreOffice has been my go-to office suite since way back when it was a twinkle in the eye of StarOffice, and I haven't looked back since. LibreOffice includes all the tools you're used to in an office suite and even includes a database component (similar to MS Access). And with a customizable user interface, you can work with a modern UI or one that recalls the days of yore. Also: 6 ways LibreOffice is better than Google Docs for serious writing workLibreOffice is installed locally, so you don't have to worry about a third-party cloud service accessing your information. You can set LibreOffice to automatically save in the MS Office default formats, so collaborating with those using Microsoft's tool is a no-brainer. LibreOffice is free to download and install for Windows. 2. Flow Launcher Flow Launcher is a quick file search and app launcher for Windows. With Flow Launcher, you use a customizable hot key to launch the tool and then search for whatever it is you're looking for. You can open apps, search for files, and browse the internet with your default search engine. Flow Launcher includes themes, animations, and sounds, and even allows you to build your own customizations. There are also community-created plugins to extend the feature set. Also: Can't upgrade your Windows 10 PC? You have 5 days left - and 5 optionsFlow Launcher is free to download and install. 3. Duplicati Duplicati is a zero-trust backup solution that can back up from Windows (or any OS) to any destination you need. You can back up to Dropbox, Box, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, or Amazon Web Services, or to other machines on your LAN for greater privacy. Duplicati allows for scheduling and remote management, and it has a straightforward installation. Your backups are fully encrypted, and you can easily monitor them for real-time insights via a well-designed dashboard. Duplicati is free for personal use. 4. Nextcloud If you're tired of using Google or Microsoft's cloud-based offerings (especially out of fear that they are using your data to train LLMs), there's always Nextcloud, the open-source, locally run alternative to cloud services. Nextcloud includes everything you need for file storage, sharing, collaboration, communication, organization, and more. There's also an app store where you can install plugins to extend the feature set. Also: Your Windows PC has a secretly useful backup tool - here's how to access itYou can install and use Nextcloud on Windows for free and even install the Nextcloud Desktop client for even easier usage. 5. Franz If you use several messaging apps and services, you might want to consider Franz, which brings them all into a single, user-friendly GUI. Franz lets you add WhatsApp, Facebook, Messenger, Slack, Telegram, Google Calendar, Discord, LinkedIn, Trello, Office 365 Outlook, Google Keep, and more, so you don't have to switch back and forth between apps. You can add as many accounts as you want and easily switch between them without leaving the Franz UI. Also: 5 tools I trust to keep my online conversations private and anonymousFranz is free to install and use. 6. YAZB YAZB (aka YAZB Reborn) lets you create custom Windows top bars (similar to macOS) that display helpful system information, such as battery status, internet speeds, weather, and more -- all with a clean, minimal, elegant style. YAZB also gives you quick access to shutdown/restart controls, customizable themes/icons/layouts, and allows you to add as many helpful widgets as you need. 7. File Converter If you've ever needed to easily convert or compress a file in Windows, File Converter has your back. Using a right-click context menu entry (within the file manager), you can convert audio, video, images, and documents from one format to another. In the case of documents, you can convert nearly any format into a PDF. You can also compress files in the same way. Also: How to upgrade your 'incompatible' Windows 10 PC to Windows 11 - for freeThe only caveat is that to convert MS Office files, you'll need MS Office installed. You can customize the application order within the context menu and even add or remove presets. File Converter is free to install and use on Windows. 8. Bitwarden If you don't use a password manager, you should start immediately. If you need a password manager, you should place Bitwarden at the top of your list. Not only is Bitwarden open-source, but it's also one of the best password managers on the market. With every feature you'll need (including a web browser extension), Bitwarden can do more to help keep you protected by simplifying the process of using strong, unique passwords. This open-source password manager includes a password generator (that can do both passwords and pass phrases), Bitwarden Send (to send files and text safely), and more. Bitwarden can be installed and used for free on Windows. You might even consider purchasing a license, as it gives you more collaboration features, which can come in handy with a large family or organization. 9.

Super comfortable titanium and magnesium frame. Smart AI integration. Better battery. Wide prescription lens support. Optional R1 smart ring makes control simpler.TIREDSoftware stability remains an issue. Smart ring is an extra $249. Navigation needs a little finessing. The display is tricky to read in bright light.In the 19 months since Even Realities launched the G1, its first pair of smart glasses, the four-eyed tech landscape has evolved at a pace. Ray-Ban has sold more than 2 million Meta Glasses, Oakley has joined the fun, and CES 2026 was awash with options from companies including Lucyd, RayNeo, Xreal, and MemoMind.The Even G1 originally stood out partly because the glasses featured a brilliant heads-up display, but mostly because they only looked “smart” in the sartorial sense. They weren’t perfect, with glitchy controls and more software updates than Windows 98, but the potential was huge.Launched in November 2025, the new Even G2 smart glasses weigh just 1.26 ounces, boast a 75 percent larger display, and can also be controlled by the Even R1, the company's first-ever smart ring. I’ve been wearing one for a few months and have been astounded by the technology on show and impressed by the updates, but some of the first-gen woes remain.What’s New?Photograph: Julian ChokkattuThe Even G2 glasses don't look especially different from the original G1, which is a good thing, because they are still arguably the sharpest-looking smart glasses available. There’s still a choice of G2 A—a classic oval shape—and G2 B, with a rectangular frame, in gray, brown, and a new muted green colorway.Even Realities G2 Smart GlassesRating: 6/10$599 at Even RealitiesThey are around 0.28 ounces lighter than the original, thanks to the new combination of aerospace-grade magnesium alloy and titanium temples. It’s not a huge difference, but the profile is a touch slimmer too. As a result, they feel even more like a normal pair of glasses.Like its predecessor, there are no cameras or audio playback, with the company preferring to keep its tech discreet. Notifications, navigation cues, translations, and AI-assisted prompts appear briefly in your field of view, then disappear. Paired with the new R1 smart control ring, the system is designed to keep interaction subtle.Photograph: Julian ChokkattuThe display system has been upgraded, with Even HAO 2.0 (Holistic Adaptive Optics), which pairs micro-LED projectors and gradient waveguide optics with precision-engineered lenses to produce a display that’s roughly 75 percent larger and significantly sharper than the original. Look carefully at the lenses and you’ll see a faint rectangle in each eye. This is where the projector displays crisp green digital text. Brightness can be adjusted to a searing 1,200 nits, making the display easier to read in variable light. There's also a second menu screen that floats in front of the main notifications page.The G2 gains IP67 water and dust resistance, and prescription support has improved to cover −12.00 to +12.00 diopters. Given how thin the lenses are, this is an impressive feat of engineering. Battery life is also improved, up from 1.5 to two full days.Controls are better now, too, and the touch panel on the temple tips is more responsive, with a quick touch or slide. But the headline upgrade is the $249 R1 smart ring. This zirconia ceramic and medical-grade stainless steel ring serves as both a thumb controller for the G2 interface and a wellness tracker, letting users scroll, tap, and interact without touching the glasses while also capturing metrics like heart rate, steps, and sleep. It has the potential to be a powerful tool, mixing a bright but discreet heads-up display with equally clandestine control from the ring.Smart EyesAimed squarely at the business professional, the Even G2 is designed to make work life easier. The Teleprompt feature is superb if you want to add polish to your public speaking, and it’s made all the better thanks to the bigger display. Add text via the app, and the microphone follows along as you talk, bolding the words in real time. You pause, and it pauses.Even AI is the onboard virtual assistant—pulling information from a mix of Gemini, ChatGPT Perplexity, and Even LLM—that can help answer questions without reaching for your phone. Just say “Hey, Even!” and ask. As with the first generation, when this works well, it’s brilliant, and concise answers swiftly appear for me to read, and using the R1 ring, scrolling longer answers is intuitive too. Sadly, while the results are accurate, it can often take far too long to process and display them. It needs to be a fluid interaction, and it’s just not quite there yet.Even Realities G2 Smart GlassesRating: 6/10$599 at Even RealitiesThe Navigate widget has been updated, and both the map view and speed of directions are much clearer than before. As a cyclist, I have used this feature more than any other and found it reliable, although the always-on map display is irritating, and pop-up alerts would make for a better experience.Translation has also improved, with support for 33-plus languages, and translations appear faster and more fluent than before. It’s still hamstrung by being predominantly a one-way transaction, but you can now hand over your phone to the person you’re talking to, so both of you can see their speech translated and displayed. When Even Realities finally adds audio to future smart glasses—and it will—this will be a brilliant feature.Photograph: Chris HaslamThe biggest innovation comes in the form of Conversate, the company's AI-driven conversation assistant. Once activated, it listens to your conversation and processes speech in real time. It identifies key topics, terms, and questions as you talk, then displays contextual cues—such as explanations of concepts, definitions of technical words, basic biographies of people mentioned—on the heads-up display. It also generates a live transcript and a summary you can review later in the app. In practice, it works impressively well, and mentioning famous people, sports teams, and events in history did indeed bring up prompts and facts in real time. The transcription aspect is excellent too, with accurate summaries and suggestions.I had hoped it would turn me into a sports stats guru down the pub, secretly being able to recall long-since-retired soccer players and obscure nuggets of information. It’s not quite there yet, and at times it would lag behind the chat and become a hindrance rather than a help, but it did suggest a cure for a friend’s particularly painful hangover.Having information flash up on screen is handy, but I found reading and digesting this information, while maintaining a conversation, to be pretty difficult. I’d occasionally be caught staring off into the middle distance mid-chat. The display is easy to read in most instances, but changeable light, especially sunshine, and chaotic backgrounds don’t help. Walking also bounces the display—like an erratic autocue—so think twice before trying to impress on a walk-and-talk with the boss.Even Realities G2 Smart GlassesRating: 6/10$599 at Even RealitiesAnd then there are the ethical implications of Conversate. Unlike Meta’s smart glasses, there’s no visible indicator that a conversation is being recorded. Even Realities told me the audio isn’t saved, only the transcribed text, but it still feels like something you should ask permission for before switching it on. I can see the appeal of having AI quietly prompting you during a meeting or even a job interview if you’re brave, but that usefulness arguably depends on it being covert, which puts you on thin ice. At the same time, openly flagging that you’re using AI would rather defeat the point.App AffairScreenshotEven Realities via Chris HaslamThe payoff for having such “normal-looking\" glasses is that the Even G2 is wholly reliant on its app and a stable Bluetooth connection. Available for iOS and Android, the app, much like the heads-up display, is a stripped-back monochrome affair, with easily accessible modes.Navigation and setup are intuitive, and it’s easy to adjust settings, choose how the HUD appears in front of your eyes, enable notifications, and decide what you want on the main dashboard. You can choose from news outlets (including WIRED), plus calendar and stock information. It’s sparse, but if you need instant access to the Nikkei Index, you’re sorted.I like how minimal and easy to navigate the app is, but not the number of times I’ve had to reboot, upgrade, connect, and disconnect the glasses during testing. The pair I received was still in beta, so bugs are to be expected, but even after the official launch and rollout of the consumer-ready app, it remains a lottery as to whether the G2 glasses and R1 ring will work as smoothly as they should.Software stability was the biggest issue I had with the original G1 glasses, and I’m annoyed it hasn’t been resolved here. I’m fine with firmware updates, especially with emerging tech like this, but not being able to rely on the glasses when I need them is hugely frustrating.Bling RingSporting a touch-sensitive surface along one side, the Even R1 ring (a $249 optional addition) lets you tap, swipe, and hold with your thumb to navigate the glasses' interface. It’s a genuinely useful accessory that makes day-to-day use of the G2 far easier than tapping the temple tips. Aesthetically, it looks good, though the Even logo wouldn’t have been my first choice. It does at least serve a purpose, indicating the correct orientation so the touchpad is within reach.The ring makes a big difference to usability and interactivity. You can scroll subtly without touching the frames, making it easier to forget you’re wearing smart glasses at all. There is a learning curve, and if you absent-mindedly fidget with your fingers, as I do, you’ll open menus by accident. It does get easier and smoother with practice.The R1 also tracks your sleep, steps, and heart rate, which is a neat touch. It’s not as accurate as my Garmin smartwatch or Whoop band, and the information is presented in a more rudimentary way, but there’s potential if you haven’t already invested in a wearable.Even Realities G2 Smart GlassesRating: 6/10$599 at Even RealitiesBattery life is a respectable four days for the ring, and the charging stand is nice. It is an expensive add-on, pushing the total (before prescription lenses) to $848, but having used the glasses both with and without the R1 Ring, I think it is money well spent.Last LookPhotograph: Chris HaslamAs a glasses-wearing tech journalist, I really love the idea of the Even Realities G2. Having AI help with tricky conversations, translate languages, answer questions, keep me up to date with my messages and emails, diary dates, and news headlines, without relying on my phone, is a brilliant idea.The design and engineering that have gone into these smart glasses is seriously clever. Getting the lenses that thin, while increasing display size, improving the fit, and reducing the weight points to a time when this technology will be seamlessly integrated into our regular rims. The G2 feels like the future, and they can be genuinely useful day-to-day. The fact that they also feel like standard glasses just adds to the appeal. The company also plans to open the software to app developers for third-party apps, a smart move indeed.At $599, they’re a premium choice. It’s more than I would personally spend on a pair of glasses, no matter how “smart” they are, but if you’ve already bought the Rimowa luggage, the Mont Blanc fountain pen, and the Tom Ford suit, this won’t be an issue.So the screen has improved, the glasses are better in most ways from the first generation, and the use of AI has evolved nicely with Conversate. But the day-to-day enjoyment and experience of the Even R2 glasses and Even R1 ring is hampered by slow connections, signal dropouts, software glitches, and all too frequent updates. When it works, it works brilliantly, but a product like this, one aimed at the busiest of professionals, needs to be absolutely friction-free. The hardware is ready, the software just needs to catch up, and quickly, especially with the Meta Ray-Ban Display hot on their heels.Even Realities G2 Smart GlassesRating: 6/10$599 at Even Realities$599 at Even Realities"

Close Home Tech Smartphones 3 upgrades the Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra needs for me to take it seriously (as an S25 owner) The Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra looks like another incremental upgrade, and these rumored omissions have me concerned. Written by Prakhar Khanna, Contributing WriterContributing Writer Feb. 10, 2026 at 3:47 a.m. PT Reviewed by Elyse Betters Picaro Prakhar Khanna/ZDNETFollow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra was one of the most reliable phones launched last year. It had a big, sharp screen with a unique anti-reflective coating, powerful performance, and versatile cameras. However, I couldn't use it full-time because of an ergonomically poor design and an aging telephoto camera. Also: Samsung Unpacked 2026: 5 biggest rumors I'm seeing on Galaxy S26 Ultra, Buds 4 Pro, moreThere have been rumors pointing toward similar downsides for the Galaxy S26 Ultra. I'm concerned about Samsung's upcoming flagship phone. 1. Where's the telephoto camera upgrade? Kerry Wan/ZDNETAccording to ETNews, the Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra will have a 200MP primary camera, accompanied by a 50MP ultrawide lens, a 10MP 3x telephoto camera, and another 50MP 5x telephoto sensor. The 200MP camera is fully capable of shooting high-resolution images, but the 3x zoom camera is due for a big upgrade. Also: I changed 10 settings on my Samsung phone to significantly improve the user experienceSamsung has relied on the same sensor for 3x zoom capabilities for a couple of years now. It was weak last year, when Apple pushed the limits in videography with its 4x telephoto camera, and Chinese manufacturers had perfected portraits and macro shots with improved processing. If it is the same telephoto camera in 2026, it doesn't stand a chance against competitors. I hope Samsung updates the post-processing to improve the output from its 10MP sensor, but I'm not super optimistic. If the Galaxy S26 Ultra sticks with the same 3x telephoto camera, I'd advise more people to use the 200MP camera mode and crop photos later instead of zooming in on the viewfinder. 2. Please, just focus on the ergonomics Kerry Wan/ZDNETLast year, Samsung slashed the weight of its Galaxy S25 Ultra to 218 grams -- a big feat for a mainstream flagship phone, especially since none of the $1,000-plus phones from Apple or Google weigh less than 230 grams. Despite a lighter design, it was harder to use than the heavier Galaxy S24 Ultra, which wasn't too comfortable due to its sharp corners, and the Galaxy S23 Ultra before that. The on-paper weight can be misleading because an unergonomic design can render a phone difficult to use in day-to-day life. That is exactly what happened with the Galaxy S25 Ultra. Also: Why the Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra's biggest upgrade won't be its camera or processor for meSamsung gave its flagship phone a boxy design, which looks good, and I like it, but it forgot to taper the edges on each side. As a result, when you hold the phone, its sides dig into your palm. Both the Apple iPhone 17 Pro and Google Pixel 10 Pro XL do better in this regard. If the latest leaks are any indication, the Galaxy S26 Ultra could feature the same sharp, flat sides as before. According to a now-removed video shared by leaker Evan Blass, the upcoming Samsung phone could retain the boxy look with flat sides. It looks similar to the Galaxy S25 Ultra, and I cannot say for sure whether the edges on both sides have been tapered. If not, I will be disappointed because I need my phones to be comfortable to hold without adding a case. 3. I hope the S26 Ultra isn't more expensive Kerry Wan/ZDNETThe Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra is not guaranteed to get a price hike, but rumors are split on whether it is going to cost the same as its predecessor or be more expensive. Samsung could be facing pressure from component price hikes, but the Galaxy S25 Ultra already cost $1,300 at launch. Also: Own a Samsung phone? Changing these 7 settings will extend its battery life by hoursTo put things into perspective, $1,300 for the base version is more than Apple and Google's big flagship phones. While Samsung has doubled the storage to 512GB for the same price as part of launch offers, it is still in a tough spot. Modest upgrades, but new tech is promising Samsung recently teased a new display privacy feature debuting with the Galaxy S26 Ultra. There is no official name for the feature yet, but it is expected to be called Privacy Display -- and it could be a big deal for both regular consumers and business users. It could work similarly to a privacy screen protector, which prevents strangers from snooping on your private data in public. Also: If these Samsung Galaxy S26 rumors are true, I might finally put my Google Pixel loyalty to restThe Korean company is said to achieve this through pixel-level light control, adjusting its OLED emission so that light only shines toward the user when the display is viewed straight on. It won't reduce the phone's overall brightness or color depth, unlike a physical privacy screen protector. I am looking forward to it the most. If Samsung can make a comfortable-to-hold phone, the Galaxy S26 Ultra has a lot going for it, despite some modest upgrades on paper. Featured Want local vibe coding?

Decent camera. Long software support. Nice AMOLED screen. Day-long battery life. Expandable storage.TIREDFrustratingly slow performance. No headphone jack.“Camera failed.” That was the first time I tried to look at a photo I captured on Samsung's $200 Galaxy A17 5G smartphone. I've now spent more than two weeks using it as my primary phone, and I can't wait to switch to something else.Yes, it's $200, so expectations shouldn't be high, but I didn't have as frustrating an experience with the same-priced Motorola Moto G (2026) I tested a month prior, and I'd argue you're better off waiting for a $300 phone to go on sale for an overall richer experience. It's unfortunate because the Galaxy A17 5G does have some great qualities, but you can't trust it to be reliable.Low MemoryPhotograph: Julian ChokkattuThe biggest problem with the Galaxy A17 is performance—it's powered by Samsung's Exynos 1330 chipset, but you can more specifically lay the blame on the limited 4 GB of RAM. International versions of this phone come with 8 GB of RAM, and I daresay they perform better. Many of the performance woes happen when you try to do one too many things simultaneously.Samsung Galaxy A17 5GRating: 5/10$200 $180 at Amazon$200 $180 at Best Buy$200 at SamsungThe worst offender is the simple swipe up from the bottom to go home or to switch to a previous app. With gesture navigation turned on, the Galaxy A17 constantly thought I wanted to trigger Google's Circle to Search feature, which would cause the phone to freeze and stutter until it finally loaded the capability. It was so bad that I eventually had to turn Circle to Search off.Forget trying to multitask. I'd be filling out a form or reading a story in Google Chrome, but if I switched to another app and then came back to what I was doing, the Galaxy A17 would often refresh the entire app again, causing me to lose progress and start over.Even notifications came through slowly sometimes. When I'd try to log into a service and get a one-time password for security, the texts would never come through until I actually loaded up the Messages app. Notifications from Google Home for my security cameras came through at first, but over time, they became sporadic, and sometimes never arrived despite seeing them on my other devices. Sometimes when I hit “Delete” on email notifications, the notification just stayed there unchanged.Photograph: Julian ChokkattuEven without juggling various tasks, performance is sluggish in general. You'll wait a full second or two after swiping down on the home screen just to see your notification drawer. App launches take a beat, and scrolling through Instagram is choppy despite the 90-Hz screen refresh rate. A lightweight game like Pako Forever was also very stuttery; playable, but not very enjoyable.There are moments when performance is perfectly manageable—after all, I have used this phone for more than two weeks, and it's not at the bottom of a lake (yet). But those lag spikes make it very inconsistent, and if there was a moment when I really needed to do something quick on my phone, I wouldn't trust the A17 to handle it.Samsung Galaxy A17 5GRating: 5/10$200 $180 at Amazon$200 $180 at Best Buy$200 at SamsungMy benchmark scores aligned with my real-world assessment. The A17 ranked slightly higher than Motorola's $200 Moto G in single-core performance, but much lower in multi-core performance, indicating that the Motorola device generally has it beat when you're juggling multiple apps. That makes sense, because I do not recall having as frustrating an experience with the Moto G when I tested it a month ago. Don't get me wrong, that phone is also very slow and annoying to use, but I wasn't this flabbergasted.The Good BitsI haven't had any issues with the 6.7-inch AMOLED display—it gets bright enough in sunny conditions, and it's sharp enough. The single mono speaker is serviceable, though it's easy to block when holding the phone in landscape orientation. There's a microSD card slot to expand on the 128 GB of storage, the phone is IP54-rated to withstand rain, contactless payments have worked OK, and the fingerprint sensor is reliable. GPS has been fine, though Google Maps can sometimes glitch out, especially if you try to do something else while navigating.I've dropped the A17 a few times (less than 2-foot drops), and it has held up surprisingly well, so it gets an A+ for durability. If it matters to you, there is no headphone jack here (Motorola retains it on the Moto G). It's also great to see that this phone will receive six years of software updates, far better than anything Motorola offers at this price. There's a good amount of bloatware you'll want to remove, but the software experience is otherwise similar to other Samsung phones. If you're a fan of One UI, you'll feel at home here.Samsung has stuffed a 5,000-mAh cell here, but battery life is rather unremarkable. It lasts a full day with average to heavy use, but if you use the phone sparingly, then it'll easily stay alive through a second day. There's no wireless charging, unsurprising for a budget phone, but 25-watt wired charging means it's not terribly slow to recharge.1 / 8ChevronChevronPhotograph: Julian ChokkattuMain camera.Samsung Galaxy A17 5GRating: 5/10$200 $180 at Amazon$200 $180 at Best Buy$200 at SamsungThe main 50-MP camera is where Samsung beats its Motorola peer more decisively. When it finally loads and takes the picture (be patient), the images it spits out are decently detailed and not too oversaturated. Things take a turn for the worse in low light, with significantly more grain and loss of detail in darker areas. Moving subjects in low light? Just forget about it. Overall, though, it's a passable camera. Just don't bother with the 5-MP ultrawide or 2-MP macro.If your budget is strictly limited to $200, I would buy the Moto G 2026 over the A17, even with its inferior screen and lackluster two-year Android OS upgrade policy; the Motorola looks much nicer and simply performs better. But I urge you to save just a little bit more cash. The smarter move is to be patient and wait for $300 smartphones, like the Moto G Power 2026, to inevitably go on sale. In a few months, expect it to dip below $250. Samsung will also likely release a $300 Galaxy A27—succeeding the Galaxy A26 from 2025—in a few months, and it will be a better buy if you can wait for a sale.Or you could just buy used and save yourself the frustration. Swappa, for example, has the Galaxy S23—just two generations behind—unlocked in good condition for $236. That's a flagship smartphone from 2023, meaning it'll deliver significantly better performance, not to mention a great camera system. Yes, the Galaxy A17 is a usable $200 smartphone, but do you really want something that's going to annoy you every single day?Samsung Galaxy A17 5GRating: 5/10$200 $180 at Amazon$200 $180 at Best Buy$200 at Samsung$200 $180 at Amazon$200 $180 at Best Buy$200 at Samsung"

Close Home Tech Services & Software Operating Systems Windows Your Windows PC has a secretly useful backup tool - here's how to access it Looking for a traditional yet flexible program to back up your personal files? Windows has a built-in tool you can use. Written by Lance Whitney, ContributorContributor Feb. 10, 2026 at 3:15 a.m. PT Reviewed by Elyse Betters Picaro Lance Whitney / Elyse Betters Picaro / ZDNETFollow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.ZDNET's key takeawaysWindows has a hidden backup tool in Windows 10 and 11.It can save files to discs, drives, or network locations.Deprecated by Microsoft, so expect occasional errors.Regularly backing up your files is always a good idea, just in case any important or irreplaceable ones go missing. For that, you can turn to a variety of programs. But Windows itself has a built-in backup tool that's simple and flexible. The catch is that you probably don't even know it exists.Named simply Windows Backup, this feature lets you choose which folders and files to back up. You can back up only select files or all your Windows folders. You're supposed to be able to include an entire system image in the backup in case you ever need to restore Windows in full. Also: How to upgrade an 'incompatible' Windows 10 PC to Windows 11 - 2 free optionsThe limitation here is that you can't save the system image on removable media. But you can always use the system image tool to do this separately. Further, you can save the backup to a recordable CD or DVD, an external hard drive, or a network location. You can also set the backup to run regularly. The tool works the same in Windows 10 and 11. Is there a catch?But as always, there is a hiccup here. This version of Windows Backup has since been deprecated by Microsoft, which means it's no longer supported or updated. As a result, you may encounter issues or errors when using the tool. In my experience, it generally works reliably. However, the last few times I tried using a network share as my backup destination, I received an error that the specified network location cannot be used. Although I confirmed that the network path, credentials, and other settings were correct, I still received the same error. I've seen posts from other Windows users complaining of the same problem. Your mileage may vary, but keep this in mind when choosing your backup destination. Also: Your Windows 11 PC has a secret emergency shutdown feature - here's how to use itTo add to the mystery, Microsoft offers a newer tool also known as Windows Backup. (Yes, Microsoft loves to use the same names across different products to confuse people.) The newer Windows Backup is designed to back up and restore certain files and settings. The main objective is to help you move from one PC to another. In contrast, the older legacy Windows Backup that I'm covering here operates more like traditional backup software. Both tools serve their purpose. But here's how the older, legacy Windows Backup works and how to use it to back up anything you want, to any location you want. 1. Prepare your destination media First, you'll want to set up the media for storing the backup. For this, you can choose a CD or DVD, an external USB drive, or a network share. I typically use an external drive. Make sure the media is connected and has enough space. Depending on the number of files and the size of the backup, you'll want at least 16GB to 32GB of storage.

In the right pane of the Backup and Restore window, click the link for \"Set up backup.\"Also: 4 Linux distros that make Hyprland easy to try - and one is truly glorious Show more Screenshot by Lance Whitney/ZDNET 3. Choose an external drive If you wish to use an external USB drive, select the appropriate one at the next screen. Click Next. Show more Screenshot by Lance Whitney/ZDNET 4. Choose a network location If you want to attempt to store the backup on a network share, click the button for \"Save on a network.\" Type the name of your NAS or network drive and click Browse. You'll be prompted to enter your username and password for the network. From the dropdown menu, select the share name and folder in which you want to save the backup. Click OK. Enter your username and password in the Network credentials section. Click OK again to proceed.Also: After 30 years with Linux, I switched it for Windows 11 - and found 9 serious problemsAs I said before, trying to use a network share as the backup location triggers an error on my end. That's one reason I always use an external drive at this point. Show more Screenshot by Lance Whitney/ZDNET 5. Decide what to back up At the next screen, you can opt to let Windows select which files to back up. In that case, the backup will include the folders and files in your libraries, the ones on your desktop, and the default locations under your user profile. Otherwise, you can choose which folders and files you want to back up. I typically select the option to let me choose. Make your selection and click Next. Show more Screenshot by Lance Whitney/ZDNET 6. Select the folders to include in the backup If you opted to let Windows choose, the default locations are checked for backup. Otherwise, drill down through the tree and select the folders you want to include in the backup. When done, click Next.Also: 5 free Windows PC apps I always install first (and how they improve your workflow) Show more Screenshot by Lance Whitney/ZDNET 7. Schedule the backup At the next screen, set the schedule at which you want the backup to start. Click the link for \"Change schedule\" and choose how often the backup should run, on which day, and at what time. I typically set the backup to kick off once a week on a Friday afternoon. When ready, click OK. Show more Screenshot by Lance Whitney/ZDNET 8. Review the settings At the regular screen, review the folders to be included and the schedule. If you need to make any changes, click the back arrow at the top to return to any previous screens. Otherwise, click the button for \"Save settings and run backup.\" The initial screen will indicate that your backup is in progress. When that status disappears, the backup is complete.Also: Want to self-host for free? This server OS makes it easy - here's how to get started Show more Screenshot by Lance Whitney/ZDNET 9. Restore a file or files Now let's travel to the future, at a point when the backup has been running regularly.

Return to the Backup and Restore (Windows 7) window and click the button at the bottom for \"Restore my files.\" Show more Screenshot by Lance Whitney/ZDNET 10. Look for the files At the next screen, click Search if you know the full or partial name of the files you wish to restore. Otherwise, click \"Browse for files\" to browse among all the backed-up files and select specific files, or \"Browse for folders\" to check out all the backed-up folders and select a specific folder. Drill down through the backup until you find the location of the backed-up folders or files. Select the files you want to restore and click the Add files button.Also: How to clear the cache on your Windows 11 PC (and why it greatly improves performance) Show more Screenshot by Lance Whitney/ZDNET 11.

If the files are missing, you can restore them to the original location. If they still exist but won't open or are corrupted, you may want to restore them to a different location. When ready, click Restore. Show more Screenshot by Lance Whitney/ZDNET 12. Check the restored files A message tells you that the files have been restored. Click Finish.

Close Home Tech Computing Laptops How much RAM do you really need in 2026? A Windows and Mac expert explains Considering a PC upgrade, but unsure about how much RAM to buy? Here's what a tech expert recommends. Written by Cesar Cadenas, Staff WriterStaff Writer Feb. 10, 2026 at 2:01 a.m. PT Reviewed by Kyle Kucharski Cesar Cadenas/ZDNETFollow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.ZDNET's key takeawaysRAM allows computers to run fast and optimally.16GB is now the standard for PCs and laptops.Heavy users may need more RAM. Know when to upgrade.I used to struggle when shopping for a new computer -- there's a lot to keep in mind. Over time, I learned to narrow it down to what I call the \"performance trifecta\" -- three main components you should be mindful of: processor, storage drive, and RAM. A good processor is the brain of the computer, and a lot of local storage means you'll have plenty of room for all your files.Also: RAM prices are ridiculous in 2026 - here's how my PC buying advice is changing this yearBut what about memory? It's a component many people fully understand (I was certainly a part of this group). RAM, or random access memory, is essentially a computer's short-term memory. Instead of saving data directly onto an SSD, the computer stores files temporarily in the RAM for quick access, resulting in faster performance. The higher the RAM (measured in Gigabytes, or GB), the more memory it has. There's a lot of information and differing opinions regarding RAM and how much you need on your computer. Should you opt for the laptop with the 32GB LPDDR5X RAM, or will 16GB be enough? I'm here to cut through all the fog and provide easy-to-understand advice on the amount of memory you should get. How much RAM do you need in 2026? Kyle Kucharski/ZDNETThe short answer: it depends on the operating system. For Windows machines, 16GB of RAM has become the operational minimum on new consumer laptops. Modern workloads have ramped up to such a degree that less RAM on a Windows device is fine, but it will limit you to everyday tasks like writing emails, internet browsing or watching YouTube videos. But let's be real here: the average worker is probably running dozens of tabs in their browser, a handful of apps in the background, and (possibly) generative AI, all of which demand memory power. In that sense, most people using their Windows laptops for work will want at least 16GB (for a value-driven, future-proof option) for a smooth user experience. Also: Skipping this PC maintenance step could cost you - here's the right way to clean your systemIf you're upgrading to Windows 11, Microsoft says the minimum requirements are 4GB of RAM, but I'd still recommend 16GB as the baseline standard. If you have more than that, even better, but for most PCs, Windows 11 should run about the same as older operating systems. Kyle Kucharski/ZDNETWhen it comes to MacBooks, things are a little bit different. Because Apple's machines are so optimized to handle daily workflows, 8GB of RAM goes a bit further than a stock laptop running Windows. In fact, it wasn't until fairly recently that Apple made 16GB the starting point with the new MacBook Air M4. MacBooks with 8GB are still solid machines for daily use, while more powerful models like the MacBook Pro and MacBook Pro Max offer substantial power with 24GB, 36GB, or more, making them some of the most powerful laptops on the market (and some of the priciest).Besides Windows and Macs, Chromebooks are a third category of consumer laptops that have seen a spike in popularity over the last few years due to their lower average price and lightweight operating system, ChromeOS.Also: My proven way to speed up Linux when RAM upgrades aren't worth it (and it's free to do)Because ChromeOS is so streamlined, Chromebooks can get along just fine with 8GB or even less, making them great machines for handling the basics like working out of the browser and having your Google Suite at your fingertips with snappy performance and a low price. The trade-off, however, is that you'll have less access to apps you'd otherwise find on Windows. All in all, it's true to say that the more memory you have, the better your computer should perform. But having too much RAM can also be a poor return on investment, because you end up spending money on a resource you hardly ever use to its full potential. It's like owning a big house but only using a few of the rooms. When buying a new laptop, I just recommend having a clear understanding of what you want to use it for -- that way, you can set realistic expectations about how much RAM you need. ZDNET RECOMMENDS M4 MacBook Air Apple's M4 MacBook Air raises the bar for ultraportable laptops with more default memory, better external display support, and higher overall performance. View at Best Buy ZDNET RECOMMENDS Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 Lenovo's Chromebook Plus 14 brings an OLED display and marathon battery to the Chromebook line. View at Best Buy What does DDR5 mean? Kyle Kucharski/ZDNETSometimes, when shopping for a computer, you'll see the letters \"DDR\" followed by a number. This is an acronym that stands for \"double data rate.\" Without getting too deep into the weeds, DDR is a type of technology that improves the data transfer speed from RAM to other components, such as the processor. There have been five main DDR generations so far, with the latest and fastest standard being DDR5. Similar to 16GB of memory, DDR technology has effectively become the new standard for RAM as users demand faster speeds. There are also variations of the technology. A notable version is LPDDR5X, which stands for low-power double data rate 5X, a more energy-efficient version of DDR5 designed specifically for mobile devices. Don't expect DDR6 RAM to be released for a computer near you anytime soon. We saw the JEDEC (Joint Electron Device Engineering Council) announce the release of LPDDR6 back in early July. The JEDEC is the organization that established DDR as a computer standard. The technology is available for manufacturers to implement in their devices, but whether or not it'll happen -- or how soon -- is yet to be seen. When should you upgrade? Jason Hiner/ZDNET16GB is fine for most cases, but if you're a gamer or creative professional, you should consider 32GB of RAM. More RAM will ensure that the games you play and the video editing apps you use for work run more smoothly. I have that amount for my personal computer, and I'm very happy with that setup because I don't just write. Also: I recommend this older Windows 11 laptop over some newer models - here's whyI also play games on my desktop, edit photographs and videos, and run virtual machines, among other things. It's a heavy workload that requires the correct amount of resources to operate; even then, I am considering upgrading my PC to have more. It's not uncommon for me to see my workload take up over 70% of my computer's total RAM. I consider anything above 32GB of memory excessive unless you're a specific type of user. If you're editing 8K videos or running heavy apps simultaneously, then you'll probably need 48GB or 64GB of RAM. A good laptop that can deliver would be something like the M4 MacBook Pro or the Dell Premium 16. These are solid, top-of-the-line machines capable of tackling tough workloads. I'm not the only one who recommends 32GB for gaming. Back in November 2025, Microsoft published a handy guide on how to optimize your gaming PC setup, and the post includes a recommendation for how much memory you should have. And wouldn't you know it -- Microsoft recommends 32GB of RAM for users who play resource-demanding titles or mod-heavy games. ZDNET RECOMMENDS Dell Premium 16 Built for demanding workloads, the Dell Premium 16 is especially well-suited for creative tasks like graphic design and 3D modeling. View at Dell Why should you trust me? I've been writing about both software and consumer electronics for almost 10 years now, and in that time, I've worked in many different settings, from the traditional office to the home office, and even someone's backyard. The remote experience has made me extremely selective about what I choose to make my main computer, as I want to ensure the devices I use can handle my day-to-day tasks.
