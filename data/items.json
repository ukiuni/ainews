Specifically, it makes images significantly brighter and lessens shadows. Dolby Vision being too dark has been a common complaint from LG users, especially those watching in bright rooms where sunlight or other bright lights are shining on the screen. In before-and-after images, the difference is striking. Given that the C5 has a fairly impressive brightness compared to its counterparts, it makes sense that the upgrade would be most noticeable on that set. Also: LG G5 vs. LG G4: I spent hours testing both OLED TVs, and this model was the surprise winnerOne Reddit user shared an image of the latest version's changelog, which notes that \"this update is a specific picture quality fix addressing user complaints regarding Dolby Vision brightness,\" adding that the fix resolves an issue where Dolby Vision content (usually in Cinema Home mode) appears significantly darker than standard HDR10 content. LG added that the update also impacts Cinema Home, Vivid, Game, and Standard modes, but doesn't affect Filmmaker Mode, which it leaves alone to preserve creator intent.That last part is important. While Dolby Vision strives to keep the \"creative vision of content producers,\" it can sometimes clash with living room viewing situations. Giving people access to a better picture for their situation while leaving Filmmaker Mode untouched gives you the option to pick which one you prefer.You can tell if you have the update by looking for software version 33.30.92. Go to your settings menu, then \"All Settings\" and find \"Support.\" Click on \"Software Update,\" and you'll see what version you're running.

The union Solidaires Informatique, which represents French workers from a number of companies in the video game sector, including Blizzard and Ubisoft, had previously called for strikes to take place on January 27. Their demands included a 10 percent increase on all salaries and the implementation of a 4-day work week.\n\nSome striking employees held up signs outside Ubisoft’s Paris headquarters, with one (pictured) wearing a Rabbids mask to hide their face. Their grievances are wide-ranging. As well as reportedly laying off hundreds of employees already in 2026, Ubisoft also introduced a mandate for its staff to return to work on site for five days a week. One employee who publicly voiced their disapproval of the new policy was reportedly fired for doing so.\nUbisoft has had a rocky start to 2026 on the software side too.

Written by Adrian Kingsley-Hughes, Senior Contributing EditorSenior Contributing Editor Feb. 12, 2026 at 8:35 a.m. PT Don't use these in your AirTags! Adrian Kingsley-Hughes/ZDNETFollow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.ZDNET's key takeawaysLIR2032 Li-Ion rechargeables resemble the safer CR2032 cells, but there are big differences.They have higher voltage but much lower capacity.I've come across several AirTags damaged by these rechargeable cells.I'm trying to remember life before Apple AirTags. I used to misplace a lot of stuff, and I've accumulated more than a few gray hairs after frantically tearing my couch apart looking for keys.That's now a thing of the past, and I have AirTags on anything important that can get lost: keys, wallets, suitcases -- even my bike.Also: I extended my AirTag's battery life to 10 years with this $15 accessory - how it worksThe only drawback of AirTag ownership is that I'm chucking out a handful of old CR2032 button cells every year. It feels wasteful, but there's no real alternative (well, you can power AirTags from AA and AAA batteries, but this makes them significantly bigger).To address this, one local business thought they'd found an alternative. A holiday rental property had turned to AirTags to keep an eye on keys after losing several sets. AirTags helped to both reduce business costs to replace them and the amount of deposits the customers were losing.Also: So many button batteries I've tested have hidden dangers - but this brand gets it rightBut, like me, the company didn't like the handfuls of button cells they were having to throw out every year, so they replaced them with rechargeable cells. After all, LIR2032 cells are the same size as CR2032 cells, and they'll fit into the same battery slot. Surely they're the same, right? Wrong.Regular, disposable CR2032 cells have a nominal voltage of 3V and a power capacity of 240mAh. LIR2032 might look the same, but these have a higher nominal voltage of 3.6V and a much lower 40mAh capacity -- that's six times less. There are higher capacity rechargeable cells called LIR2032H, but these still only have about 70mAh. They might look the same, but LIR2032 are very different to CR2032 cells. Adrian Kingsley-Hughes/ZDNET This means, at best, much more frequent battery changes (every two to three months, as opposed to once a year). But there are other problems with using these batteries. First: they die rapidly and with little or no warning, which can leave whatever the AirTag is attached to vulnerable to being lost. Another issue is that these batteries can be discharged to a point where they can't be recharged. This can damage the battery, and I've seen a few of these cells leak the electrolyte while in use, something that could damage the host device. I've seen a few AirTags damaged by these rechargeable cells. The cells can also be damaged by incorrect charging.Also: I gave my AirTag a 5-year battery life with this accessory - and it took just minutes to set upBottom line: although it's tempting, I don't recommend using these rechargeable cells in AirTags! I know it feels wasteful to have to put a bunch of CR2032 cells in the recycling every year, but it's better than buying a battery that doesn't last long, could die without warning, and could even damage your AirTags.My advice instead, is to use good quality CR2032 batteries in your AirTags (I recommend Energizer Color Alert cells, which have several safety mechanisms to prevent accidental ingestion). Keep the rechargeable LIR2032 batteries for devices that have them fitted from new (things like car keyfobs, and solar-powered calculators).

    "summary": "Today, we’re going to talk about the role AI might play in deciding legal disputes. Not just drafting memos and doing research — actually deciding who’s right and who’s wrong, and who should pay.\nMy guest today is Bridget McCormack, the former chief justice for the Michigan Supreme Court and now president and CEO of the American Arbitration Association. The AAA has been around for exactly 100 years and is the country’s largest nonprofit arbitrator.\nYou’ve probably heard of arbitration before. It’s is a form of dispute resolution that allows two parties to resolve conflicts outside the formal court system using a third, neutral party — the arbitrator — to negotiate a settlement.\n\n\n\nVerge subscribers, don’t forget you get exclusive access to ad-free Decoder wherever you get your podcasts. Head here. Not a subscriber? You can sign up here. \nYou may have never found yourself in arbitration, but you’ve almost certainly signed an arbitration clause, in one of the many contracts and terms-of-service agreements that all of us have to sign all the time. Arbitration can be much faster, cheaper, and easier than going to court, so it’s become a favored way of resolving disputes between businesses. It’s also, as it turns out, how many employers and large corporations defend against lawsuits, because they can sneak an arbitration clause into the agreements for everything from cellphone service to smart washing machine features or even your employment contract, which can protect them down the line from class action claims. \nArbitration is everywhere in our legal landscape, so you can see why an organization like the AAA would want to make it faster, cheaper, and more predictable. For the past several years Bridget and her team have been developing an AI-assisted arbitration platform called the AI Arbitrator, and it’s now available for use in very specific cases — construction disputes that can be resolved entirely on the basis of written documents. As of right now, the AI Arbitrator now has officially one case on its docket. \nI’m obviously fascinated at how all of that might work, but you’ll hear Bridget and me really dig in here on what this kind of automation means not just for arbitration, but also the bigger, more fundamental idea of seeking justice, and whether or not our legal system feels fair. \nAmericans’ trust in the judicial system reached a record low in 2024, and you’ll hear Bridget and me go back and forth on whether a system driven by AI can actually help people trust these systems more simply by making each party feel heard and showing its work, something you often don’t get from a human judge. \nAt the same time, AI systems are AI systems. They’re new, brittle, and hallucinate facts and dates. It feels like there’s real danger in handing this kind of power to such a new, and unpredictable, technology. So you’ll hear Bridget discuss where she thinks the lines should really be drawn, how she’s trying to head off some of the big concerns around AI, and where she sees this going in the future. \nAgain, Bridget was the former chief justice of the Michigan Supreme Court; she was in charge of all the judges in her state. You’ll hear her say several times that people are unreliable. By the way, if you want a broader look at all of this, Verge reporter Lauren Feiner actually published a fantastic feature on AI in the legal system last month, and I highly suggest you go read that if you’re interested in learning even more. \nOkay: Bridget McCormack, the president and CEO of the American Arbitration Association, on the AI Arbitrator. Here we go.\n\n\nThis interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity. \nBridget McCormack, you’re the president and CEO of the American Arbitration Association. You’re also the former Chief Justice of the Michigan Supreme Court. Welcome to Decoder.\nIt’s great to be here. Great to see you.\nYou and I were on a panel a while ago. You were talking about rolling out AI in arbitration. You were also talking about your history overseeing judges in Michigan, which was very funny. I’m very excited to talk about all of that with you. \nI just want to start at the very beginning. I suspect you and I are going to end up talking a lot about commercial and business disputes. There’s a lot there to discuss in the context of AI and arbitration. Most people’s experience of arbitration is that they just sign a contract. \nYou were the Chief Justice in Michigan; you oversaw the literal legal system in that state. American Arbitration Association is 100 years old, so now you oversee a 100-year-old dominant provider of arbitration. Explain to people what the difference is.\nIt’s a great starting point. The thing about being the Chief Justice of the Michigan Supreme Court is that, like every state Supreme Court, the Supreme Court of Michigan has administrative oversight of all the courts of the state. When you’re the chief justice, you’re kind of the CEO of the public dispute resolution system that most people are stuck dealing with, if they need a little justice or if somebody wants a little justice from them.\nLike other leadership roles, I had a leadership team and another 300 or so staff of folks who reported up to the leadership team. And it was our job to try and figure out how to improve the experience of people across the state of Michigan who had to go to their local courts because of some legal problem. It’s an enormous change management job for lots of reasons that are not true in my current job.\nThe thing about running the public dispute resolution system, like the state court system, is that your funding isn’t based on how well you do. You can’t perform well one year and have extra revenue for R&D. You have to walk over to the legislature and convince some brand-new representative from Leelanau County that online dispute resolution is really going to increase access to justice. You literally have to pick off legislators from around the state to try and fund what you know is going to be a better way of doing business. \nAt the same time, there are the judges across the state in Michigan, and there are approximately 1,000 judicial officers. I say that because in addition to judges, there are magistrates that report up. They’re all separately elected and they work in counties that have their own funding systems. So they’re partly funded by the state and they’re partly funded by their county.\nThe counties across Michigan are differently resourced, right? Some counties have a larger tax base than others, and they have a bigger budget to work with. So convincing separately elected judges with different budgets that we’re going to do business a certain way going forward is super complicated. It’s a very fun change management problem. \nThe AAA, on the other hand, is basically a court system, but a private court system, although I should say at the top, the AAA is a nonprofit. We’re a fee-for-service nonprofit, but we’re a nonprofit. We’ve been administering alternative dispute resolution arbitration, but also mediation and any other alternative process parties want, for 100 years as of last Thursday. So we’ve been doing it for a long time and we have administered over half a million cases a year for the last few years, and not just domestically but also in cross-border disputes.\nMost of them are B2B commercial disputes, but there are also B2C cases, employment consumer cases, and a growing number of self-represented parties. A lot of small and medium businesses, as I’m sure you know, can’t afford legal help. They’re legally naked. And so arbitration is an easier way for them to manage disputes.\nI want to talk about the difference between a private dispute resolution system and the public dispute resolution system for one more second. But first, actually, you just said something. I’m so curious about it. It sounds like, as the Chief Justice, you had a role advocating for the court system with the legislature, inside the justice system. \nMost people never hear about that and never think about that. What was the split in your time? How often did you have to spend time just saying, “Hey, can you pay for the courts?” versus actually being the Chief Justice?\nI would say the administrative part of the job was significantly more than half compared to the decisional part of the job. It’s an enormous job.\nMichigan adjudicates between 3 and 4 million cases a year, and like every other state court, a majority of people who go to court to have cases resolved can’t afford lawyers. This is the primary place people interact with their government. The kind of justice we deliver, the quality of justice we deliver, it’s pretty important to, frankly, the rule of law and trust in institutions. I think it’s one of the most important jobs in government.\nI’m curious about that because it feels like the experience you had there really leads to your perspective on how and why AI should enter the legal system. \nYep.\nThe reason I’m starting here with your previous experience and not your current job is—I encounter this on our show and on our site all the time—that people think the legal system is deterministic. Particularly our audience, the tech audience, thinks the legal system is a computer. You can feed it inputs and it’ll API access the law, and then you’ll get some predictable outputs. I’m always trying to convince people that that’s not the case. Even hearing you talk about the politics of running the legal system underlines for me that the legal system is absolutely not deterministic. Should it be?\nYeah.\nBecause you’re the first person I could just like straightforwardly ask that question to. Should the legal system be more predictable and deterministic?\nIt absolutely should be, at least in a majority of cases. In fact, if it were more deterministic, we would have fewer disputes, right? It’s because it’s probabilistic—and I agree with you. It is, for the most part, because it’s run by humans. You’ve met humans, right? They’re flawed. \nAnd therefore it isn’t always predictable. If it were more predictable, we would be a more efficient and effective system. We’d avoid a lot of disputes because people could plan their business around what, in fact, the rule was going to be, and how it was going to be enforced, and how they could count on it being enforced. In my view, that’s true for most cases for which there is a rule of law, and we know how it’s been interpreted historically, or at least how it’s been correctly interpreted historically by the majority of courts.\nThere are always going to be new frontiers in legal. Cases where courts are having to decide how to interpret a new statute. Courts are going to have to figure that out for the first time. That’s not going to be able to be deterministic. It could get better and better, frankly. I think AI could do a very good job at the front end of statutory drafting, in making sure there was less ambiguity in statutory terms. AI could impact that. But there are even still modern questions about historic provisions in statutes and the constitutions, state and federal, that we have entrusted judges to decide. So I don’t think it can all be deterministic. I think an awful lot could be, and it would improve the way the law operates.\nWhere do you think that the source of uncertainty in the legal system, as people experience it today, comes from? Is it just that most people can’t afford a lawyer? Is it that some percentage of judges are just weird old guys? Where does that come from?\nI don’t think there’s a single answer. I do think it’s relevant that 92 percent of Americans can’t afford help with their legal problems, and that’s not just individuals in the kinds of cases individuals end up going to court for. It’s also true for all small and medium businesses. For the most part, they can’t afford lawyers.\nSo there’s an awful lot of trying to navigate legal risk and legal problems without lawyers, and that’s complicated. That’s very complicated for judges. Judges who are managing large dockets with many parties without lawyers try and do their best to work their way through those problems, but it’s not easy. We have a legal system run by humans and humans are imperfect and busy. \nI want to be very clear that there’s a big difference between state and federal courts, right? So 95 to 96 percent of cases are heard in state courts, not federal courts. The federal courts do a much smaller number of cases, and generally have—not better, but larger—staff to help them. State courts are managing most disputes with fewer resources and doing the best they can. But if you look at the rate of reversals by appellate courts, by intermediate appellate courts and state Supreme Courts, they’re getting a lot wrong, right? Humans get things wrong for lots of reasons. \nWhat you mean by that rate of reversal, just to unpack that, is that someone goes to court, a state court judge decides there’s an appeal, which costs money, and that goes up to an appeals court, and the appeals court is overturning that judge. You’re saying that rate’s going up or that rate is too high?\nI don’t know if it’s going up. I could probably figure that out, but I don’t know that off the top of my head. It is a fact that it’s quite high. The number of cases where an appellate court reverses the work of a lower court is not a low number. It’s going to be different from state to state and different in the federal appellate courts, but you can benchmark it and it’s not an insignificant number.\nI like to use this example. I ran a non-DNA innocence clinic two careers ago, and we know a lot about the rate of wrongful conviction as a result of the DNA exonerations over the last, I don’t know, 30 years at this point, because there’s a database now, and we’ve been able to learn both the rate at which mistakes are made—sometimes they’re made by juries, but often they’re made by judges—and the kinds and qualities of the errors that lead to those mistakes.\nIt’s a shocking number. The wrongful convictions tell us that in 3 to 5 percent of cases, there was an error made. And you might think, “Oh, that’s kind of a low number.” If you’re shooting free throws then probably it is a low number, but if you’re landing planes, not a great number, right? And I think the criminal justice system should be more like landing planes.\nThe reason I’m starting there is, and I think you perceive this as well as I do, that the lack of faith and trust in our institutions is kind of pervasive across American society. The legal system is just part of it now, right? Especially if you show up and you don’t have a lawyer, you don’t have the money, and then it is a weird old guy as the judge, and then you’re looking at the statistics and they’re probably wrong, but you can’t afford to appeal. Or you’re just reading the headlines every day. It just feels like there’s more chaos in the formal legal system than ever. \nI wanted to start there, because I do feel like the lack of faith in our corporate institutions is equally high, and most people’s experience with arbitration is, “Well, I just need cell phone service. I’m not going to read this contract or these 15 contracts to get cell phone service.” And there’s a line here that says, “Well, I can’t even sue AT&T if they get something wrong. I’m going to end up in arbitration and that arbitration is obvious. Of course, it’s just going to be against me. There’s nothing I can do. I’m just signing away my rights.”\nHow do you feel about that in this context? Because that feels like as big of a problem as anything.\nSo let me unpack a couple of things you said. I completely agree about the declining trust in institutions, and that the courts are part of that problem. In fact, the National Center for State Courts tracks that. And I think their data shows declining trust in the courts. Frankly, that trust is declining faster in the federal courts than the state courts, but even the state courts are struggling with that. I happen to believe that the way most Americans are locked out of our formal justice system is as important to that declining trust as any other factor, and there are other factors. \nBut like any other public good, imagine if we said, “If you want to drive on the highway, you can do that, but you have to hire a driver.” Or, “Oh, you want to register your kid for public school? No problem. It’s a public good, but you’re going to have to hire a special person who will go and sign you up for public school, because otherwise it’s in Latin and you can’t understand it.” We would never accept that, but we accept that most Americans are locked out of their formal justice system because—and I don’t know why—but we set up a legal system 250 years ago and the legal profession is better than any other at avoiding any disruption.\nBut to the second part of your question, I do think that there has been a narrative that if your consumer contract—whether you bought an appliance or a cell phone, or sometimes employment contracts designate arbitration as the forum for resolving disputes—that that must mean this is not going to go well for you. In fact, the data that we have is that people are far more likely to actually get a hearing and get some award when they navigate an arbitration process than when they navigate a court process.\nThe reason for that is probably obvious. If you have to navigate a court process, but you can’t figure it out, that’s really complicated. In arbitration, we can make resources available to parties who are representing themselves, and we do everything remotely and make it easy for people to actually navigate it. So cases are far more likely to actually go to a hearing and more parties are heard in arbitration than they are in courts, but that perception definitely is out there.\nIt may well be the case that there are other providers that have fewer resources for self-represented parties or aren’t as focused on it. At the AAA, we actually require businesses that want to put our clauses and contracts to file those contracts with us, and they have to satisfy our due-process protocols. And I’m not sure that’s true of every organization. Many are for-profit and that is probably an issue in other places.\nI’m starting with this issue of fairness, because when you automate the systems, all of the things that make things feel fair or unfair get heightened, or magnified, in very specific ways. I just want to ask one more question here, and then I do want to go into why we should automate some of these systems. The idea that just getting a hearing and some outcome is substantially more fair, I feel like we could unpack that for another week.\nThere’s a reason these companies want to not be in the formal justice system. They don’t want precedent for the awards that they’re made to give to the parties that come and sue them. They certainly don’t want it in the public record that any of these things ever happen. They don’t want discovery, and all that stuff you don’t have to do in arbitration. So maybe it’s easy to participate in, but there’s still a benefit to them that accrues over the long run. How do you balance that out?\nThat’s not true of employee arbitration. Those cases are reported. So they actually do have to live with those results. And it may well be that for some businesses, they’re choosing arbitration because it’s a more efficient way for them to resolve disputes. I don’t know. You see them going back and forth between arbitration and litigation. I think Amazon recently wrote litigation back into—maybe not all, but a lot of—their consumer contracts. I’m not going to speculate about why, but I think parties are always thinking about what the best forum is.\nThere’s a robust literature on procedural fairness and procedural justice that goes something like this. And I won’t waste time on the details of it, but if parties feel like they were heard and that they understand the process, they understand what happened and why it happened—in other words, if the neutral [party] deciding the dispute can explain it to them—they’re far more likely to grow trust in institutions. It used to be a sort of a big deal in training judges. We would remind judges how important it was that people feel heard. And even if you’re going to rule against them, they will take bad news for them and still grow trust in the institution, if they feel heard and understood and they understand what happened.\nThat matters because today’s parties are tomorrow’s witnesses and tomorrow’s jurors. You want to grow trust. In every case, usually one person is disappointed. That’s just how disputes go. But I don’t know if you’re right. I’m not sure I agree with you that getting some award isn’t important. There’s data from a bunch of arbitration scholars, or really dispute resolution scholars, who did some recent work on employment arbitration, and the number of cases that just get summaried out in court, where an employee has a claim or believes she has a claim against her employer, is quite high. \nThat’s maybe not surprising to you, but that just simply doesn’t happen in employment arbitration. In arbitration, you’re far more likely to actually get to go tell your story. So I’m not sure I agree with you that there’s a clear fairness narrative, based on the facts.\nThe one thing I will definitely say here is, in my mind—we cover big tech companies, and I’m just thinking about the clauses that everybody has to sign in their terms of service agreements, and you’re obviously thinking about employment arbitration, and they’re wildly different universes.\nYeah.\nSomething we could spend another week on is how I think terms of service agreements should be illegal. But that’s a different podcast for a different time, maybe with more booze.\nYou mention that people just feeling heard leads to trust. I think that is the transition I want to make to AI. You mentioned that idea to me the first time we spoke about this, and I’ve been thinking about it ever since. If there’s one thing an AI system can do, it is just making you feel heard. In every positive way that that can happen, in a startling number of new and, quite frankly, shockingly negative ways, the AI systems will just listen to you, over and over and over again.\nYep.\nIs that something, as you have developed the AI arbitration system, that you’ve leaned into? Is that the heart of it? Because if that technology can do one thing, it is just listen to these parties until they’re done. \nI do view it as a significant advantage of an AI dispute resolution system, and we can talk more about when that’s appropriate and when it’s not. I don’t think every dispute should go to an AI dispute resolution system, but [rather] when parties prefer it. For me, at the front end of what we built, which is a very narrow product right now, I undervalued it and underappreciated it. \nAt the front end of our AI arbitration process—which is really a series of agents that operate across the process on the back end, even though the parties are interacting with one—the agents take in the party’s complaints and whatever pleadings they’re filing and whatever evidence they think supports their claims, and then a series of agents parses the claims, the elements of each claim, the evidence that may or may not support each claim, what the parties believe supports each claim, and the legal framework that surrounds it.\nAnd then it goes back to the parties and says, “Here’s my understanding of what the claims are, what your claims are, party A, and yours, party B, and what the elements are and what the evidence is and what the legal framework is. Did I get that right?” And the parties get to say, “You did.” Or, “No, you didn’t. You missed this one element or this one claim, or the fact that this evidence supports both of these claims, not just one.” And then it goes to work again. The agents go back until the parties are satisfied that they have been heard and understood.\nMaybe we could do that in courts, but we would have to spend a whole lot more money. Imagine if judges in trial courts, or even in appellate courts, did that. In appellate courts, you file briefs and then you wait by your computer for months and months and months to see when some white smoke emerges from the State Supreme Court building, and then you get a decision, and the decision may or may not have even addressed all of the issues that you raised. That happens all the time. I reviewed 2,000 cases a year, 2,000 applications a year, when I sat on the Michigan Supreme Court, and I can’t tell you how in many of them, the intermediate appellate court didn’t even rule on issue number three. They just ignored it, and we just want an answer.\nSo imagine if courts could do that. Imagine if trial judges or appellate judges could pull the parties in and say, “Here’s my understanding. Did I get it right?” And then we could actually be satisfied that they did. That’s probably not going to work in our bespoke, built-for-18th-century-norms system, but it can work for disputes in an AI dispute resolution system.\nSo let’s talk about your actual product. Right now, I think it’s just for documents-only in construction disputes, right? That’s where the product is.\nThat’s right.\nDescribe why you picked that, and then walk me through step by step. How do you use this thing? Is it an app? Is it a website?\nYeah, it’s a website. Although I assume we will have an app version of it, and we have an app version of all of our services. You can log in on your phone, but you’re logging into the case management system. So really it’s two things. We built an AI-native case management system for the AI arbitrator to operate on. That effort is time well spent because it’ll replace our legacy case management system for all disputes within two years. That’s going to be something everybody has an opportunity to benefit from, because it saves time and money.\nBut the AI arbitrator is, like I said, a bunch of different agents—probably 20, sometimes more, depending on the complexity of dispute—that operate across the arbitration process. A bunch operate at the front end. We talked about those, that are parsing claims and organizing arguments and organizing claims, making sure the party is satisfied. And then there’s a bunch of reasoning agents, and those reasoning agents take the summary of the dispute that the parties are satisfied with and start reasoning across it. And then there are agents that do a draft award. \nThere’s a human in the loop throughout. In the beginning, it’s the parties. They are the humans that are making sure that they’re heard and understood. Then we have a cohort of construction arbitrators who serve as the human-in-the-loop arbitrator for the reasoning and award drafting. It’s the human arbitrator who ultimately issues the award, and she makes any changes that need to be made so that she’s comfortable with the award.\nWe started in construction because we have a long history with the construction industry, and a very good relationship with the lawyers and parties and arbitrators in that industry. It’s an industry where arbitration is important because, as you know, in any big project, there are always going to be disputes, and if you have disputes along the way, you don’t want your project ground to a halt. You want to be able to keep going. So they need speed and efficiency. They’re not in it for confidentiality. They just need to be able to continue to move forward.\nIt’s also an area where AI is already impacting the underlying business. The construction sites are being infiltrated with AI that’s making what they do significantly faster and better. So it’s an industry that we knew would be open to it. We do so many of those cases that we had a good library of documents-only construction cases that we could ground our agents in. Our agents are ultimately operating off a handbook, but we were able to build that and train our agents on those historical cases, and with the cooperation and in collaboration with a bunch of our construction arbitrators and lawyers.\nSo it was the right place to start because we knew they’d want it and we could work together with them.\nLet me ask you a really dumb question. What does a documents-only construction dispute look like?\nIt could be a lot of things. There are a million different ways it shows up, but [for instance] something was supposed to be completed on a certain timeline and wasn’t. And who’s responsible for that delay? There might be supplier disputes. There are all kinds of disputes that happen in the course of a construction project that don’t need testimony. You can decide those completely on the paperwork. And that was also important for us in starting this. In the first offering of an AI arbitrator, we were not prepared to have witness testimony evaluated by agents. That might come one day, but we’re not there today.\nSo you ordered the pallet of steel beams. It had a delivery date on it. They showed up. You can mark the delivery date and you can say, “Okay, that’s obviously later than what we said. You owe me some money…”\n“And here’s what the contract says about why that should have happened, but here’s my response.” And then it’s pretty straightforward, like many disputes are, honestly.\nI 100 percent feel like I’m a first-year law student back at the University of Wisconsin right now, talking about construction litigation and contract disputes in this way. So you had the library of previous arbitration in cases that looked very similar to this. You obviously have the experience and the history with the industry?\nYep.\nDid you have the software engineers you needed to build this? How did that work? Did you go hire out to do that?\nYeah.\nDid you hire in? Where did this come from?\nIt’s a great question. We started transforming our operation in early 2023. I took this job in September of 2022, but I didn’t start until February 2023. And everybody knows that in November of 2022, we all thought, “Oh wow, what’s happening?” I spent most of my six weeks off learning everything I could about large language models, and trying to figure out what it was going to mean for the legal profession and therefore our little subset of the legal profession. \nI was convinced it was going to be extremely impactful. Like you said, it can make people feel heard, and that’s a wake-up call for any dispute resolution provider. That’s obviously going to have an impact. When I got to the AAA, we gave everybody enterprise ChatGPT licenses—and I mean everybody, not just our engineers, but also our caseworkers and our legal team and our marketers, because I think with any general-purpose technology, you need the domain experts to figure out where it’s going to impact them.\nWe started building point solutions. Our AI engineers were not historic AI engineers, but like everybody else, they learned pretty quickly, and so we do have a very talented set of AI engineers. With this particular product, we built it with a partner. We did Copilots, and we built it with Quantum Black. Quantum Black is McKinsey’s AI team. \nI don’t know exactly—I’d have to ask Diana [Didia], my Chief Information Officer—but for the first four or five months, the Quantum Black engineers sat in seat one and ours sat in seat two, and then they swapped for the last five months of it. So our team then was driving, because they left after we delivered the [minimum viable product], and now we’re already building out the next products that are built on the same architecture.\nI feel like it’s another full hour Decoder on McKinsey giving its AI team a cool name. We’ll set that aside as well.\n[Laughs] I’m super interested in that one. Have me back for that one. I’m really interested in it.\n“It’s got to be really cool, you guys.” So you have the system now, you have the platform and the frameworks. As you know better than anybody, how the platforms and frameworks are built in the beginning has a pretty big effect on where they end up.\nEven just talking about witness testimony. Now there’s a dispute on, “Did it happen before midnight or after midnight?” And you need the loading dock operator to say, “Actually it was the next day. This document is wrong.” Did you build a system that can take witness testimony?\nIt can take witness testimony as long as it’s in written form. You may or may not know this—I didn’t until I started in this job—but a lot of arbitration disputes have written witness testimony. In fact, in most cross-border disputes, that’s how they take testimony. It’s literally affidavits or just written expert reports. More and more in American arbitration cases, it’s depositions. So it can do that, but it’s not going to, say, have a witness show up on Zoom and we’re going to listen to them and see if we think they’re telling the truth or they’re twitching a little in their eye, and so therefore we know they’re lying. It’s not doing that.\nDoes it kick that back to a human arbitrator anywhere in this system right now? Does that mean that’s what you would have a human arbitrator do?\nWe do. There’s a human arbitrator assigned to the case from the beginning, and anytime the parties want the human arbitrator to come in, the human arbitrator is ready and willing to come in. And you’re probably right that there’ll be some cases where, along the way, the parties will decide that they need testimony that they didn’t think they needed at the front end of the case. That’s probably going to be a case where the human arbitrator takes over, because we’re not having our agents do that for now. It’s not in our roadmap today.\nHow many cases has the system resolved so far?\nThere’s one case in the system. We stood it up in November. The first case came in, I don’t know, a couple of weeks ago. Everybody was so excited. As you know, in arbitration, both parties have to have an arbitration clause in the contract that says, “We’re going to arbitration.”\nFor now, we will not take any case unless both parties agree. And obviously there are no businesses that have put [AI arbitration] in their contract. Well, I hope now there are because we’ve been talking to people now about it for two months, but we’ll start seeing cases once contracts start showing up that have it in their contract.\nOne of the things we’ve heard from a lot of parties is they’re eager to use it as an early case evaluation tool. They want to be able to run it just on their own. They want to put all of their evidence up into it and get an early case assessment about where their case is likely to go, so they can figure out whether they even want to spend any time in arbitration. So that’s actually one of the next use cases we’re building out, which isn’t very hard, based on what we’ve already built.\nThere’s a gap here that seems very striking to me. A party that understands it needs early case evaluation because it is a repeat player in very lucrative construction disputes, and they just need to keep moving, and the cost of the settlement is enough and they can just keep moving. That’s a pretty sophisticated actor. How do you bring all of this down to, “Well, most people can’t even access the justice system?” Is there a path?\nYou’re right that many larger construction projects with extremely sophisticated parties on both sides have these smaller disputes along the way, for which this tool will probably be perfect. Many of those disputes, at this point, they just think are not even worth it. Even the large parties who know how to access every dispute resolution system don’t bring them because it’s just not worth their time. And that’ll change.\nThis will give everybody an option to resolve every dispute. But in fact, we’re seeing—again, not yet, because nobody has it in their contract yet—but our self-represented parties in commercial and construction cases, are on the rise and have been for a couple of years. I follow our case filings day by day, and the self-represented parties in commercial and construction disputes are right now—I mean, it’s one month, so who knows, maybe it was a weird month—but January of 2026 was double what it was in January of 2025.\nThis system is perfect for the smaller party construction disputes. And as you know, there are also lots of smaller construction projects where people really don’t want to have to hire a lawyer to figure out how to sort it out. It’s already perfect for those disputes.\nThe documents-only construction case is pretty constrained, right? And things happen and there’s a lot of documentation. What’s the next one you think that is similarly constrained that you could bring the system to?\nIt turns out that in lots of industries, there are documents-only disputes. I was talking to an in-house litigation leader at an energy company, and they have supplier disputes that are all documents-only disputes, and it’s probably perfect for those. Like payer-provider disputes, disputes between hospitals and insurers, which are, I’m sure you know, an enormous docket. It’s probably perfect for those if you can get them both to agree.\nValue of money means some people like to hold onto their money and they’re willing to have a dispute resolution process that takes a very long time, but those should be perfect for an AI dispute resolution process. We should be resolving those quickly and getting people their coverage. There’s actually an unlimited number of disputes for which this is appropriate. There are also some for which it will never be appropriate. \nWhere will it never be appropriate?\nThis is just my view, but I believe that criminal cases, cases where the government is accusing you of something and wants to take your liberty as a result of that accusation, or cases that individuals or organizations or even businesses bring against the government, should happen in public courtrooms, and with publicly appointed (or elected, if you’re in state court) judges. Those have to happen in courtrooms.\nOne of the things you and I briefly talked about the first time we met was the idea that there’s transparency in the state courts. There’s transparency when the government sues you and you need that transparency to build trust. You brought up the healthcare industry. There’s zero trust in the healthcare industry, and there’s a lot you could say about the consequences of the absolute lack of trust in the healthcare industry. If my medical billing goes to an AI agent, do you think that’s going to result in more or less trust?\nI don’t know. It depends on the AI agent, who built it, what their audit trail looks like, and how transparent they are about showing you what that audit trail looks like. But let me go back for a minute. I said payer-provider disputes. I’m talking about disputes between healthcare [providers] or hospitals and insurance companies. Do you think there’s a lot of confidence or trust in insurance companies? Because I don’t think so. \nNo. Not at all. And that’s kind of what I’m saying.\nYeah. But imagine disputes between those two that could be resolved instead of taking two years. So somebody’s waiting for their insurance company to tell the hospital that they’re going to cover their treatment, and they’re dead before they get an answer. Imagine if we could just resolve those right away, but in a system that transparently shows its work and shows its audits. You tell me. My guess is some people would say, “I’ll take that tomorrow. I’m waiting for my treatment. Yes, please send my dispute to an arbitration process that is transparent and shows its work. Great.”\nYeah. I think some people would.\nYeah, some people would. As I’m sure you know, there are lots of things that happen in public dispute resolution systems or even in arbitration processes, where the results are reported, where there’s not a lot of transparency. Do you understand how judges come to the conclusions they come to? We don’t get to see the reasoning that goes on in their brain. There’s no requirement that the judge shows her work and how she got from step A to step D. What was her thought process?\nHopefully, most judges are supposed to write opinions that should show some of that, but as you know, in most intermediate appellate courts, there are a lot of opinions that are not written. And in trial courts, very often there’s no written opinion. So I always want to ask, “As opposed to what?” If you believe that the current human-led, overburdened justice system is one where people have lots of confidence, I want to introduce you to some folks who might disagree.\nLook, I was told that Samuel Alito can look into George Washington’s heart and soul and determine exactly what he meant. And I’ve just been operating under that assumption for some time.\n[Laughs] Yeah. I mean, there is that. So if you think that’s a system that instills confidence, maybe, but I’m not sure everybody would agree with that.\nSo the flip side of this—and this is us covering AI at The Verge for years now—it’ll just talk to you. And some people are very happy with that, and that is far more trust than they have in even the other people who live in their houses, right? We see that play out all the time. \nThe downside of that is that these systems hallucinate at high rates, they are tuned to please you, and we can see that all over the place. They work differently than humans, they layer differently. In fact, the chances of them getting something wrong are much higher, the chances of them getting something wrong exponentially increase as you stack them up in these ways. \nHow have you protected against that here? Because it feels like, yes, you can increase this sense of agency and trust, but the downside is this thing might just be making it up as it goes along.\nYeah, it’s a huge issue, obviously. If you were to just take your dispute, and all the documents in some dispute you’re having, and throw it into ChatGPT or into Claude, you could get a result right now, right? Anybody could do that. It might be okay. It might in some cases not make a mistake. As you know, with hallucinations, you don’t know when exactly or why the frontier models are making mistakes, but that’s not what we built and that’s why we’re moving so narrowly and so slowly. \nYour system has to be governed, trained and grounded in the kind of reasoning that you’re asking it to do. So it sounds extremely narrow that we’re doing only documents-only construction cases, but there’s a reason for that. That’s where we could build a governed and harnessed agentic system. We keep a human in the loop to make sure that before an award issues, there were no hallucinations even with our governance, and we’re going to be very transparent about all of our audits, and that’s really critical to growing trust.\nI think a lot about whether the frontier models get so good eventually, that they can just do this. That you maybe don’t need an institution training and governing an agentic system in a specific kind of dispute, because we move past the age of hallucinations. It doesn’t sound like that’s imminent today, but I don’t know if it’s imminent six months from now. I didn’t know last week that agents were going to be on a subreddit talking about us. I didn’t know Moltbook was coming, right? So you can surprise me.\nFor now, I think you have to have governed, transparent and audited systems so people can grow that trust. We have a white paper. We let an academic under the tent. John Choi is a law professor, but he’s a technologist as well. And we let him under the tent to kick the tires of what we were building, to be able to test how it performs against the human baseline. And the results are excellent. So I’m excited for folks to see that when it’s all ready to go.\nBut it’s an important question, again, as opposed to what? You’ve met humans, right? And you’ve met humans who are judges. If you think they’re getting it right every single time they make a decision, I want to introduce you to some folks. Anecdotal stories are kind of useless when we’re trying to talk about something important like this, but I was the Chief Justice of the Michigan Supreme Court. I was in that role for three years, and we were working on some reforms in the probate court system, and some of the probate court judges, I guess, didn’t like them. And one of those probate court judges, from a county not that far from where I live, got on his listserv and was just talking trash about me.\nHe said that I was at a forum and I had said a bunch of stuff and how outrageous it was. Fine, people should criticize me whenever they want. The thing was, I wasn’t at that forum. My colleague, Megan Kavanagh, who is also a white woman with an Irish name, was at that forum. And I know Megan, she probably did say those things. So I called the guy. I said, “Judge, you’ve made this claim about me on the listserv to every probate court in the state of Michigan, but I wasn’t there. I wasn’t at that forum. I have an alibi.” And you know what his answer was? His answer was, “Yes, you were.” What do you do with that? I mean, what do you do with that?\nHe won. I was like, “Well, I don’t know. Okay.” I mean, what do you even do with that? So if you think that the human beings, who get tired, who get hungry, who, like all of us, come to the table with cognitive biases, are getting every single thing right, then you have a lot more trust in the public justice system than I think most people do.\nI don’t know that I have a lot of trust in the public justice system. What I know about those guys is that they get old and sometimes they go away. I wish more of them would go away at higher rates, but sometimes they go away. Sometimes they get replaced by newer, different people with different biases, and the system replenishes at some rate that feels like accountability. You can ruin that guy’s reputation if you would just say his name. And Bridget, I invite you to say his name out loud right here if you would.\nHis name was Judge… Nah, not important. Not important.\n[Laughs] Nope. It was worth a shot. It was important enough for me to ask. Anyway, that’s a system that people understand about humans, right? They have reputations, they have histories, they have experiences, you can Google them. And then sometimes they die, and they just go away, you get some new ones, and at least the system replenishes and evolves. \nAn AI system running on a cloud service that you can’t see, on a data center that you might’ve hated being put in your community, does not feel accountable to you in that way. Maybe it’s getting it right more often on whatever metric that someone who is not you has decided is important, but you can’t actually hold it accountable. That to me feels like the biggest gap in all of these automated decision systems, that no one wants to account for because the efficiency gain is so high.\nThat’s a completely fair point. And again, I go back to where I believe disputes should be decided publicly, and I think that should be true no matter how excellent [they are]. Eventually, probably the judges should be using some tech to help them make sure they don’t make mistakes that will undermine accountability and undermine trust. \nBut not all disputes are created equal, Nilay. We all have lots of disputes, some of which we think, “Well, I don’t even have the time or the energy or the resources to get that one resolved.” But if we did, if you could really resolve every dispute, if every human being could have a will or a plan for what happens if they become incapacitated or die, if every small business could plan for the disruptions that befall every small business, we’d have a better world.\nI mean, disputes are not great, right? They make a mess of economic relationships. They make a mess of personal relationships. And resolving them in fact does lead to more peace, more stability, more economic growth, if that’s your thing. Resolving disputes is good. \nRight now, we do not have any way to resolve most disputes, because our one-to-one, bespoke, built-in-1776 system is no match for the kind of disputes we have today and the volume of disputes we have today, and it hasn’t been for four decades. It’s been a very long time since public dispute resolution systems have been able to address the problems in their local communities. So why wouldn’t we have more options so people could choose the right option for them at the right moment?\nThere would be some family disputes where parents prefer not to go to court. They want to work things out privately. They can do that now: they can go to mediation and just file a resolution. That to me seems like a good idea, to be able to offer people a way to move through a dispute so that they come out on the other side, both better with respect to each other, better with respect to the other people who are impacted by the dispute, and even feel like they were able to manage that with some agency. I don’t know why we wouldn’t want to have more options for more people, to give them agency.\nMy wife, as it happens, is a divorce lawyer, and I do think an AI agent of her just talking her clients through the decisions that were made a long time ago, over and over again, would actually be very helpful for her in many ways, because that seems like a lot of her job. \nI understand what you’re saying there. You said this thing to me the first time we met that, again, I’ve just been thinking about it ever since. You said that several years from now—10, 20, or 30 years from now—we would think it was crazy that we ever had human judges making as many decisions as we do today.\nYep.\nYou’ve got one case in the system. Has that born out? Do you feel that as strongly as you did when we first talked a few months ago?\nYeah. I don’t know exactly when the world turns and we’re finally able to manage lots of disputes in different ways, including with AI dispute resolution systems, but I feel pretty confident we will get there. I think I said to you at that time, and I still agree, that in some number of years, we will think it’s amazing that we let humans drive cars. \nWhen my kids started driving, it was the most terrifying time of my life, right? Not really for them, but I couldn’t believe we were letting them out onto the public roads with all these innocent people out there driving cars next to them. At some point we’ll think that was insane, that we let people drive cars. \nI think we’ll also think it was probably crazy that we thought a human being had to oversee the disputes between private parties who want to be able to move through that dispute and be at a better place. That inserting a human with her flaws and her biases and her limitations was no way to manage this railroad. Again, not for all, just for some.\nOne thing I’ve been thinking about throughout this conversation is who gets access to these systems? Who gets to make it feel fair? Where does the trust in the agency come from? A pervasive criticism of arbitration, broadly, is, well, it’s a service, right? It’s fee-for-service even though the AAA is a nonprofit. There are other, I would say more rapacious providers of arbitration services that do run them as for-profit businesses. You have clients. The clients have to be happy with the outcomes, and that does feel like it changes how people perceive the whole process. As you automate that, and you have big clients who are paying for lots and lots of arbitration, and they can see that the automated system is either helping them or hurting them, should that affect how people think about the fairness of the system overall, that these are fundamentally your clients and you’re building a tool for them?\nThis is where I feel very, very lucky that we have a nonprofit mission, and our mission is to expand access to alternative ways of resolving disputes to as many people as possible. But we’re like a court, right? We do serve parties, but there are two parties in every case. There are parties on both sides of every dispute, and we need to make sure both sides, both parties, feel satisfied with the dispute resolution process they got. \nI thought you were going to say, “As the cost comes down as a result of AI automation, even for parts of disputes or full disputes, depending on the dispute, and it’s therefore harder for dispute resolution providers who need to make money, to make money on that process.” That would be a problem, and I can see how it might be. But again, I’m really happy that at the end of the year, I don’t have a bunch of owners that are looking for their profits.\nWe have a mission. If we can bring the friction and the cost of dispute resolution services down significantly, and therefore offer it to a whole lot more people, we’re serving our mission.\nLet me just contrast that to your previous role in the state courts as the Chief Justice in Michigan. The Michigan Supreme Courts belong to everybody in Michigan, right?\nYeah.\nNo matter who the parties are, they’re yours. You’re paying taxes. You walk in and maybe they work and maybe they don’t, and maybe no one knows who was at the function saying what, but it belongs to you in some way, equally. There was recently a case where Disney said to somebody who tried to sue them in a theme park, “You signed the arbitration agreement for Disney Plus. We’re going to arbitration.” That’s pretty one-sided. That forum does not belong to both parties equally.\nThat imbalance seems like where the loss of trust, at least in the consumer side that I cover so much, comes from. How do you make sure, even as a nonprofit, that the party that is paying for and driving the system, doesn’t make sure the automated system doesn’t favor them over time, because that’s a pretty easy outcome to start programming in.\nSuper good question. As you know, it is easier to train a data set than a human. So frankly—and let me step back for a minute. In our consumer cases, again, we do not accept consumer B2C cases, unless a business has cleared their clause with our due-process protocols. So we’re, again, in a lucky position there, I guess. But back to who’s in charge. For us, if the consumer feels like the process wasn’t fair, that’s not going to work. We’re in the business of actually giving more options to more parties. And if half of the parties in one kind of dispute type—I should say, we mostly do B2B cases—but when we do B2C and they’ve satisfied our due-process protocols, it’s critically important to us that both sides feel, in the individual case, that they were treated fairly.\nIf it’s algorithmic, if it’s automated to some extent, even in part, that’s just as true, but easier to show our work. We did a lot of training, judicial training, and we do a lot of arbitrator training when human arbitrators decide cases, to make sure that the parties get equal treatment, fair treatment. But you can de-bias the data set a lot easier than you can de-bias a human. And so when you benchmark and do your audits of your AI arbitration system, and you show your work, you can either convince the public that it’s treating both people fairly or you won’t. That’s for us to show.\nAs you can tell, I’m fascinated. The reason I keep poking at this is that our readers at The Verge, like every other consumer in modernity, live a life of signing contracts, and you don’t get to negotiate those contracts. But you literally cannot participate in society without having signed dozens upon dozens of arbitration agreements. \nI hear you say, “We have to get it right. We can’t get it wrong.” What is the mechanism of getting it wrong and then being forced to change, when no one can negotiate the contract that landed them in arbitration in the first place? Do you know what I mean? If there’s some public accountability that’s like, “The AAA got everything wrong for a year with the AI system,” then what? Because I can’t go to all of my service providers and say, “I don’t want to use the AAA anymore. I saw this news report.”\nYou’re asking, when you enter into any kind of B2C contract, you’re buying a new refrigerator, you don’t really get to scrutinize it and say, “I want to change the last clause.” People aren’t really entering into arbitration agreements. Arbitration clauses are just part of contracts they’re entering into. \nIn the construction case, you’ve got two parties and presumably they’ve contracted for the sale of lumber, and there’s an actual meeting of the minds, and they might have negotiated in, “We need arbitration because we got to move fast.” And fine, automate that away. And if you get it wrong, maybe the next time you try something else. And there’s some mechanism of change built into that.\nI signed the terms of service for an LG refrigerator, which does have an arbitration agreement. And I’m like, “That sucked. My refrigerator exploded and the arbitrator ruled against me.” The next time I buy a refrigerator, I can’t go to LG and say, “I want a different arbitrator.” So I don’t see where that mechanism comes in for most people, because most people are just signing tons and tons of arbitration agreements all the time.\nYeah. You don’t mean, “I want a different arbitrator.” If you’re buying a refrigerator from Joe’s Refrigerator Store on your corner that doesn’t have a contract with an arbitration clause and you end up suing in court, you’re probably going to go to small claims court. You’re going to have not been able to figure out how to file properly and your case will have been dismissed. I’m telling you that’s what happens in most cases where people try to file cases in courts. \n[Laughs] I would have gotten it right.\nWell, you would have. That’s fair. But most people didn’t go to law school, and they aren’t going to get it right. And they are most often never going to make it past “Go.” I mean, look at the high volume dockets in state courts. Just take a look at how many cases are on the consumer debt docket, which is, by the way, the modal case in state court right now. Literally, the modal case in state court is a consumer debt case. And go take a look at how many of those are dismissed because the consumer, not the business, didn’t meet some, I don’t know, Court Rule 26.4A that said you had to have a triplicate when you responded to the thing.\nYou’re not going to be able to go back to Joe’s Refrigerator Store and say, like, “Hey, that court process wasn’t fair because there’s no way I’m going to be able to read the Latin and figure out that I have to file and triplicate my thing. So I want to go to arbitration where at least I can just show up and, in plain language, tell a person what happened to me, and a person will listen to it and answer it.”\nI understand that there has been a pretty successful narrative that this process doesn’t work for individuals. And I am sure there are places where it doesn’t, but not every arbitration provider and dispute resolution provider is created equal, and some have different missions than others, and that matters.\nThere could be a campaign to say to—I have no idea who; I don’t know if LG uses us or some other provider—to say to LG, “We want you to switch to a provider that actually has due-process protocols. That’s what we want you to do.” Or you could go to Congress and you could tell Congress to amend the Federal Arbitration Act to say, “No B2C cases should ever go to arbitration.” I understand that apparently that’s how legislation works, that you can talk to Congress and they’ll fix things, but I don’t know.\nThere’s a lot of hopes and dreams in this episode.\n[Laughs] Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I have no horse in that race. If Congress were to say tomorrow, “We don’t want B2C cases in arbitration, we want them all in courts,”  I think it would probably be a mistake because I’ve seen how courts operate and the resources they don’t have. Believe me, there are lots of judges who are trying to do really well by all those folks on their dockets. They just don’t have the resources or the time, and they have these archaic rules. \nSo I think it probably wouldn’t be good for everybody, but I certainly have no horse in that race. I can create dispute resolution services and processes to give everybody more options. And I want people to want those options. I don’t want people to be stuck with those options. I want to create something that’s so good that you want it. You want to go to LG next time and say, “Can you please put an American Arbitration Association clause in my contract? Because that’s where I want to resolve my dispute.”\nI appreciate the ambition. It’s a lot to think about. The idea that I’m able to negotiate the terms of service for my refrigerator, maybe that is what I think Congress should allow us to do, but that’s, yet again, a different podcast. When you think about the scope of this, the timeline of the investment that you’re making, you have one case in the system now. We’re going to see how it goes. You’ve obviously run some simulations on previous cases. \nYeah, a lot.\nYou’ve got some studies that say it’s going well. How fast does it go from here? What’s next? Is it 10 cases? Is it, “You’re on a sales trip”? What’s the speed?\nSuch a great question. There are at least two variables that we’re following. One is just how quickly our team, our engineers and the related folks that work on that Scrum team, can build it out for different case types, different documents-only dispute types. And then whether there are some institutions that want to use it for internal dispute resolution. We’ve had some interest in that. That’s going to take a while. That’s going to take us a couple of years to build out each dispute type by dispute type. So that’s slow. \nThen there’s “When does the worm turn?” And your guess on that is as good as mine. I don’t know if it’s two years, five years, or 10 years. I’d be very surprised if in 15 years people—and businesses in particular, for B2B documents-only disputes—are still opting for a slow, expensive, human-led process. I’d be very surprised. But that’s a really conservative answer to your question.\nDo you have a better answer? How quickly do you think it will happen? It’s going to go with a lot of the rest of the way technology’s going to disrupt our lives, right? It’s all kind of connected.\nYeah. If you look at our stack of guests over the past few months, we just had DocuSign on the show. Their CEO was like, “AI’s going to write the documents for you because we have access to your business intelligence.” We had LexisNexis on the show, and their CEO was like, “The lawyers will just start doing the research here and drafting out of these claims.” That seems very dangerous to me. \nBut you see this universe of legal work being automated very quickly, because the AI systems are good at words. You can either hire a 26-year-old who’s been drunk for several years—that was me—and they can be whoever they are as a first-year associate. Or you can have a robot do it and maybe that’s the same. \nI think it will happen very fast and then it will slow down, because everyone will realize there’s not a next generation of people who understand how to control the systems, and that investment still needs to be made. And the outcomes of those systems are not as good as we wanted them to be.\nYeah, it’s a completely different training. My podcast is on AI and the future of law, and I’m just talking about…You might know that two careers ago, I spent 15 years on a law faculty. So the training model is kind of broken for what lawyers are going to do in, again, two, five, or 10 years, and I don’t see anybody moving extremely quickly to figure out what the 2.0 training model is. \nNow, I want to say, I don’t think the 1.0 training model was that great. I’m not sure that sitting in the basement looking through a bunch of boxes of documents really made you an excellent lawyer or strategist or advisor. I’m not convinced that that was perfect. So I do think there’s an opportunity—I’m an optimist. I think there’s an opportunity to build a better system, but you’re right, there are going to be ways in which some of this moves faster than the rest of us and we’re not ready for it.\nOne other thing that I spend a lot of time thinking about is, “How many B2B contracts are going to be negotiated and executed by agents?” Walmart has agents negotiating and executing a significant number of their contracts. In a B2B agentic commerce world—you probably read these estimates as much as I do. Some people say that by the end of 2027, as much as 40 percent of contracts might be negotiated and executed agent to agent. So what happens when one of those agents makes a mistake? As good as they are, they will make mistakes. What’s the dispute resolution process there? And is it an on-chain process that maybe is better, like it’s an upstream automated dispute resolution process?\nI’d like to be in the conversations to figure that out, because you need that somewhere. Your agentic commerce is only as good as your process for fixing it when it breaks, but nobody’s talking to me about that. I want them to. So yeah, a lot to do yet.\nLiterally, just before we sat down, Goldman Sachs announced that it was putting AI into more of its accounting functions and other functions at the company. So you can see the acceleration. My prediction is we’re going to accelerate into it and then we’re going to pump the brakes really hard when we realize these systems are not as predictable as we want them to be. But I will have you back faster than 15 years to see how it’s going.\nOkay, good.\nI have loved this conversation. Thank you so much for being on Decoder, Bridget.\nYeah, so much fun. Great to see you. Thanks.\nQuestions or comments about this episode? Hit us up at decoder@theverge.com. We really do read every email!",

    "summary": "PlayStation’s first State of Play of the year is shaping up to be quite newsworthy. While Sony hasn’t revealed too much about what it will show off (with one notable exception), the stream is slated to last for over an hour, so there should be at least some interesting stuff. The showcase will get underway at 5PM ET on February 12. You can click the play button on the YouTube video above to watch the State of Play in English when the time is right.\nThe PlayStation YouTube channel is hosting alternative versions of the stream. One has English subtitles and the other is in Japanese. Otherwise, you can react to all the reveals live in Twitch chat.\nThe showcase will include “news, gameplay updates and announcements from game studios across the globe,” Sony said. It will “spotlight eye-catching third-party and indie games headed to PS5, along with the latest from teams at PlayStation Studios.”\nSony’s slate of first-party games has been relatively slim over the last few years, but the company is preparing to release a trio of them over the next couple of months. It’s likely that all three of those (Saros, Marathon and MLB The Show 26) will make appearances during the State of Play. Bungie has confirmed that Marathon will definitely be in the mix, though it dispelled rumors that another playtest for the extraction shooter will take place this weekend.\nThere are positive signs for news on the Silent Hill front as well. Konami has scheduled a Silent Hill Transmission presentation for 7PM on Thursday, which is soon after the State of Play wraps up. That stream will include new information about Silent Hill: Townfall, which was announced all the way back in 2022, but we could get a peek at that game during the State of Play too.\nElsewhere, we may get an update on Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls, a nifty looking tag-fighting game from Arc System Works that Sony is publishing. That’s slated to arrive this year on PS5 and PC (Steam and Epic Games Store). A recent update to the game’s Steam page — which was quickly reverted — revealed that the game will have 20 fighters at the outset, with more to come. The timing of the leak suggests that Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls may well show up during the State of Play.\nHowever, Marvel’s Wolverine, which is set to arrive this fall, may not be featured during this particular State of Play. Developer Insomniac Games indicated on X that it would reveal more details about the game this spring. However, that doesn’t entirely preclude Sony from featuring the game at Thursday’s showcase. Perhaps we’ll get even a release date, given that GTA VI (a game that most publishers will want to stay very far away from) now actually seems to be on track to arrive in November.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/playstation/how-to-watch-playstations-hour-long-state-of-play-and-what-to-expect-162128585.html?src=rss",

You’ll pay $72 upfront for 24 months of service, which amounts to 70 percent off the usual monthly rate and brings the long-term cost well below what many premium VPNs typically charge.\nWe’ve consistently been impressed by Proton VPN’s focus on privacy, its nonprofit ownership structure and the way it balances security features with strong real-world speeds. It’s a top pick in our best VPN guide, and this promotion also appears in our running list of the best VPN deals. If you’re planning to commit to a VPN for the long haul, this pricing makes Proton VPN Plus one of the more compelling options available right now.\n\nIn our Proton VPN review, the service impressed us with consistently fast performance and strong privacy protections. We measured average download speeds at 88 percent of our unprotected connection and upload speeds at 98 percent, which is more than enough for 4K streaming, gaming and torrenting. It also unblocked Netflix in every region we tested, and while its Mac and iOS apps aren’t quite as polished as the Windows and Android versions, the service is still easy to install and largely set-it-and-forget-it across platforms. We gave Proton VPN a score of 90 out of 100.\nProton VPN Plus is the company’s premium tier and includes access to its full server network, which now spans more than 15,000 servers across 120-plus countries. A single subscription covers up to 10 devices at once and unlocks features like NetShield ad and malware blocking, Secure Core “double hop” connections, split tunneling, custom DNS controls and priority customer support. Proton VPN Plus also supports fast P2P traffic on nearly all paid servers and includes VPN Accelerator, which helps maintain high speeds over long-distance connections.\nRight now, Proton VPN Plus is discounted to $2.99 per month when you commit to two years, billed as $72 upfront for the first 24 months. After that, the plan renews annually at $83.88. That’s a 70 percent discount compared to the standard monthly rate. As with Proton’s other paid plans, the subscription comes with a 30-day money-back guarantee, so you can try it risk-free if you’re not ready to lock in long term.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/get-two-years-of-proton-vpn-for-70-percent-off-right-now-123000652.html?src=rss",

But you'll have to be willing to pay to play. Written by Ant Pruitt, Contributing WriterContributing Writer Feb. 12, 2026 at 8:13 a.m. PT Obsbot Tiny 3 ZDNET's key takeaways The Obsbot Tiny 3 offers 4K video streaming that beats native setups. Its ultraportable design makes it ideal for traveling. I just wish it wasn't so expensive at $350. $349 at Amazon$349 at Bhphotovideo more buying choices feb / 2026 Follow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.Obsbot has had a nice run with PTZ (pan, tilt, zoom) cameras. I previously discussed how well its Tail 2 PTZ worked for most creative workflows and streamers, with a thoughtful feature set that's, most importantly, practical to use. Also: I camera tested the latest Google, Samsung, and Honor phones while flying - this model won the mostThat's why I was excited to check out the latest PTZ webcam, the Tiny 3, which I've quickly found to be more than just a traditional webcam. Let's take a deeper look at the camera's design and performance, and see why it's effectively replaced the native solutions that I've used in the past. Obsbot Tiny 3 PTZ Webcam Tiny but mighty Obsbot Tiny 3 PTZ webcam packs a punch with great image quality in a small package. details View at Amazon The Tiny 3 PTZ's tech specs are fairly brief, but there are some notable details. First, it's a webcam with spatial audio support and great noise reduction, both of which come in handy in busy office spaces or cafes. The camera shoots in up to UHD (4K) resolution and at 120 fps, so you can tailor the image quality as needed. I've personally kept it at 4K for crisp output.Also: 10 open-source apps I recommend every Windows user download - for freeThe 1/1.28'' CMOS sensor really performs well, especially if you have adequate lighting in your space. From what I've seen, the image quality is top-notch, and the autofocus is snappy, useful when you're moving in and out of the camera or presenting a product.Tiny, but mightyThe Tiny 3 is unbelievably small. In all seriousness, when I received the package, I thought there was a mistake until I opened it and saw that an actual webcam was inside. It's not much larger than a US quarter coin. Yet it packs a lot of processing power to handle snappy auto focus, spatial audio, and great image quality. Obsbot Tiny 3 PTZ Webcam small stature Ant Pruitt/ZDNETAI features that are actually usefulPart of the Tiny 3's autofocus prowess is due to the Obsbot AI, which was trained not only to lock on to focus but also to motion-track humans or objects. So if you're sitting at your desk and slightly shift, the camera will follow you. But even better, if your workstation is a standing desk and you'd like to move even more freely, you can. Also: I see the same 3 tablet charging mistakes over and over again - here's the right to do itThe AI tracks and follows you easily as the camera can pan, tilt, and zoom for optimal image framing. Obsbot's AI also supports gesture and voice control. This isn't anything groundbreaking, but it's available. Of course, background blur or replacement is available thanks to the AI. Here's an example. Obsbot Tiny 3 background replacement Ant Pruitt/ZDNET Obsbot Tiny 3 natural background blur Ant Pruitt/ZDNETI like that the background blur can be dialed in to fit the scene. So many users over-blur, and the image just looks cheesy. But what's offered here is quite nice. Granted, I have great lighting to make it easier on the AI.The webcam comes with a desktop application that offers more control over your PTZ webcam. Again, this isn't anything new in webcam technology, but the software is impressive. I enjoyed the idea of truly dialing in the image quality by utilizing tools to color correct or even adjust the luminance curve for great contrast and highlight control. Obsbot Control Center Ant Pruitt/ZDNETWhere the Tiny 3 can improveObsbot mentions that AI is used for spatial audio capture and voice control. In my experience (after updating to the latest firmware) I was unable to utilize the mic array on the Tiny 3. I'm not sure why. Also: I've used nearly every browser out there, and these are my top 4 (spoiler: Chrome is out)I'm a professional creator, so I know how to turn on a microphone, but for whatever reason, the mic wasn't recognized by OBS, Slack, FaceTime, or Zoom. Within the Obsbot control center software, you can toggle the mic, but nothing worked for me.ZDNET's buying adviceThe Obsbot Tiny 3 is a pretty dynamic PTZ webcam and is available online for $349. It offers great image quality and tools to help you really dial in your image. I'd recommend this camera if you're someone who does a lot of presentations and you're looking for the flexibility to pace on screen while going through your discussion points, but if you're just doing Zoom calls a few hours a week, I suggest spending less money on a stationary webcam that will still provide adequate image quality.

    "source": "Engadget is a web magazine with obsessive daily coverage of everything new in gadgets and consumer electronics",
    "summary": "Sony’s 1000X earbuds have been at the top of Engadget’s best wireless earbuds list since we first published it. With each new generation, the company managed to retain its crown, primarily thanks to a massive collection of features and an effective mix of sound quality and active noise cancellation (ANC) performance. Today, Sony revealed the latest entry in the series, the WF-1000XM6, delivering yet another redesign both inside and out. The company’s tried and true formula of features and audio performance remains, but it may no longer be enough to elevate the M6 above the competition.  \n\nDesign\nFor the third time in a row, Sony overhauled the 1000X earbuds’ design. While the WF-1000XM5 was a clear revision of the WF-1000XM4, the M6 is a departure from both of them. The company managed to reduce overall size even further by using a rounder, pill-shaped enclosure for the earbuds’ main housing. I certainly applaud Sony for making these as tiny as possible, but I’m still not a fan of the company’s foam ear tips. \nSony introduced foam ear tips on the 1000XM4 earbuds and that led to an unstable fit during my testing. In fact, I ended up switching to the silicone M3 tips for a better feel. Things were slightly better on the M5, but the company regressed here on the M6. I tried every size of ear tips in the box and the fit test in the Sound Connect app only ever confirmed an air-tight seal in my right ear. This can impact sound quality and ANC performance, and the earbuds don’t feel like they’re sitting far enough inside my ears. I never got used to the fit in my three weeks of testing. \nThe exterior panel of the WF-1000XM6 is still touch sensitive, accepting a variety of taps for playback controls, calls, noise settings and more. Sony also included a repeated tapping gesture that’s used for volume control. Keep tapping on the right earbud to raise the volume and do so on the left to lower it. My disdain for touch controls is well-documented at this point, but the M6 reliably and quickly responded without me having to repeat a tap sequence. \nWF-1000XM6 features\n\n\nAs is typically the case with its 1000X earbuds, Sony has loaded the M6 with features. Nearly all of these are holdovers from previous models, including Adaptive Sound Control that can automatically adjust settings based on your activity or location. Speak-to-Chat still pauses audio and activates ambient sound when you start talking, but it’s also still easily duped by coughs or clearing your throat. A quick access feature can put Amazon Music, Apple Music, Endel, Spotify and YouTube Music two or three taps away, depending on how you configure it.\nThe M6 earbuds also allow you to accept and reject calls with head gestures and you’ll have the option to pipe in your own voice during a call. Sony retained its existing option of operating the earbuds with voice commands: If you say “Assistant,” you can then ask it to play, pause, skip and replay songs. It will also adjust the volume for you, but that’s the extent of its abilities. \nSony included some handy power management features as well. First, there’s an Auto Power Save mode that will disable any custom EQ settings, DSEE Extreme upscaling, Speak-to-Chat and voice control/voice assistant to reduce power consumption when the M6 hits 20 percent battery remaining. A Battery Care tool will extend the life of the earbuds’ battery by stopping charging before it reaches 100 percent. Lastly, Automatic Power Off will turn the earbuds off when they’re outside of the case and haven’t been worn for some time. \nBasic conveniences like multipoint Bluetooth, wireless charging and IPX4 water resistance are also here. Wear detection is onboard and you can use Sony’s EQ presets to alter the sound profile, or make your own and save them for future use. The Sound Connect app puts the battery levels of the individual earbuds and the case front and center, and you can edit the main screen to hide the features displayed there if you don’t need them.\nSound quality and ANC performance\nIf Sony’s long list of features is its top advantage over the competition, overall sound quality is number two. For the WF-1000XM6, the company built new drivers with soft edges for deeper bass and a more rigid, lightweight dome for clearer treble. There are also notches around the edges for “clearer and smoother” sound quality overall, according to Sony. And of course, DSEE Extreme upscaling helps to recover details lost to compression while 360 Reality Audio and Spatial Sound Optimization are available for more immersive listening. \nI found the M6 earbuds at their best with the stock EQ and DSEE Extreme active, much like I have on previous 1000X models. The sound is deep and warm, with thick bass that’s adequate without ever overpowering the mix. Highs cut through and there’s ample midrange, keeping those finer details from getting lost. Erika de Casier’s atmospheric Lifetime is a great example of what the WF-1000XM6 can do. Vocals seem to float over the top of the bassline and drums, with percussive piano chopping though and subtle synth details popping up throughout. When strings arrive on “Seasons,” the M6 ushers them into a prominent position rather than relegating them behind the beat. \nOn the WF-1000XM6, the chaos of Spiritbox’s “Holy Roller” doesn’t get condensed to a messy heavy metal roar either. And there’s plenty of texture in the synth-driven noise of Nine Inch Nails’ “As Alive As You Need Me To Be.” Even more straightforward rock tracks like Jimmy Eat World’s “Bleed American” have ample punch, with a wide soundstage that never feels claustrophobic or sounds compressed. Overall, the WF-1000XM6 holds its own against the best-sounding earbuds you can buy right now, though some of the competition, like Technics, have an edge in the way they handle the subtlest of nuances in songs.  \nIf you were hoping for knock-out ANC abilities, I must report that the WF-1000XM6 isn’t the noise-canceling powerhouse that is Bose’s QC Ultra Earbuds. The M6 struggles mightily with human voices. While that’s the downfall of many ANC earbuds, you’ll want to keep it in mind if you plan to wear these in the office. I found I could also still hear constant noise sources like fans and white noise machines when wearing the M6 — items that the QC Ultra Earbuds combat effectively.\nUsing the WF-1000XM6 for calls\nFor calls, Sony says the M6 uses AI for both background noise reduction and voice capture with the beamforming microphones. What’s more, the earbuds are equipped with eight total mics for ANC and calls, plus bone conduction tech for improved voice pickup. Unfortunately, all of that doesn’t lead to stellar performance during calls. While the WF-1000XM6 is perfectly usable for voice and video calls, the overall quality is far from pristine. To make matters worse, the earbuds make you sound overly processed when you encounter significant background noise. Since the company prided itself on the upgrades here, the results are disappointing. \nBattery life\nSony says the WF-1000XM6 will last up to eight hours on a charge or 24 hours when you factor in the full longevity of the charging case. During a battery test that I mostly ran with ANC active, I had no trouble hitting that single-charge figure. That’s with the volume around 75-80 percent and includes calls and virtual meetings where I switched over to ambient sound mode. \nIt’s worth noting that I had DSEE Extreme upscaling active the entire time, which can impact battery life. Plus, if you use the aforementioned Auto Power Save mode, you can extend play time when you have about a quarter of a tank left. Going without some of the M6’s best features in the interest of having tunes for a workout or commute is a fair trade in my book. \nThe competition\nWhen sizing up the competition for the WF-1000XM6, you have to choose your priorities. Simply put, no other company offers the comprehensive suite of features that Sony does. That’s been true for a while now and it continues with this model. If you want the strongest active noise cancellation, that will be Bose’s second-generation QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds. If the best sound quality is your goal, the Technics AZ100 is your best bet in this price range. I’ll also mention Sennheiser’s Momentum True Wireless 4 which offers great sound quality, respectable ANC and a comfier fit than the M6, but that set is almost two years old at this point.\nWrap-up\nSony continues its run of great earbuds with the WF-1000XM6, but this model isn’t the polished package that some of its predecessors were. The two most obvious places the company is lagging behind the competition is ANC performance and overall voice quality, not to mention my continued dissatisfaction with the fit that Sony’s foam tips provide. The M6 is also more expensive than the previous version was at launch, which makes it even harder to overlook any flaws. What you will get on the WF-1000XM6 is a ton of features, great sound quality and reliable touch controls in a smaller package. And for some, that might be enough to make you forget about the rest. \nThe WF-1000XM6 is available today in silver and black for $330.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/audio/headphones/sony-wf-1000xm6-review-facing-tougher-competition-160000652.html?src=rss",

Close Home Tech Wearables Headphones Sony WF-1000XM6 vs. Apple AirPods Pro 3: I listened to both earbuds, and this pair wins The battle of ecosystems is at the center, but these factors matter, too. Here's my verdict. Written by Christian de Looper, Contributing WriterContributing Writer Feb. 12, 2026 at 8:00 a.m. PT Jada Jones/ZDNETFollow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.The Sony WF-1000XM6 and Apple AirPods Pro 3 are two of the best wireless earbuds on the market right now, and picking between them is trickier than you'd think. Sony's latest pair comes with a fresh design, new drivers, and the same chip that powers the stellar noise cancellation in the WH-1000XM6 over-ears. Also: My simple tweaks that bring dead-sounding headphones back to life - Sony and Bose includedApple's AirPods Pro 3, on the other hand, have taken what was already a really solid product and pushed it further with better ANC, a comfortable stem design, and the kind of deep ecosystem integration that Apple does better than anyone. These are both premium earbuds with premium price tags, and both do a whole lot right. But they also offer different strengths. The Sony WF-1000XM6 have the edge in audio quality and give you way more control through their companion app, while the AirPods Pro 3 boast better noise cancellation, a more comfortable fit, and a bunch of Apple-only features you just can't get anywhere else. So which ones should you actually buy? Here's a look. Specifications AirPods Pro 3Sony WF-1000XM6Battery life 8 hours (up to 24 hours with charging case) 8 hours (up to 24 hours with charging case) Charging USB-C, Qi, MagSafe, Apple Watch USB-C, Qi Audio modes ANC, Transparency Mode, Adaptive Audio, Conversation Mode ANC, Transparency Mode IP rating IP57 (earbuds only) IPX4 Bluetooth version Bluetooth 5.3 Bluetooth 5.3 Additional features Hearing aid mode, live translation, Automatic Switching, Spatial Audio, heart rate monitor Spatial Audio, LDAC support, Bluetooth Multipoint Price $249$330 You should buy the Sony WF-1000XM6 if... Jada Jones/ZDNET 1. You want better audio quality Audio quality is where the Sony WF-1000XM6 earbuds beat most of the competition. They sound excellent -- rich, detailed, and versatile across pretty much any genre you throw at them. Bass is smooth and full without overwhelming everything else, while instrument separation is impressive, and the overall tuning is both warm and reasonably clear. To be clear, the AirPods Pro 3 sound excellent, too, offering deep, powerful bass and great detail in the high end. Their bass is a little less smooth than the Sony earbuds, though, and it's slightly less neutral. Also: What is Bluetooth 6.0? How the latest standard is changing audio right before our eyesThere's also the fact that the Sony earbuds are a little more customizable when it comes to audio response. Sony's Sound Connect app offers a full 10-band EQ spanning 31Hz to 16kHz, along with a good selection of presets. That means if the stock tuning leans a bit warm or a touch heavy in the high mids for your taste, you can tweak it until it's exactly where you want it. Apple, meanwhile, doesn't give you any EQ controls at all -- it sets the sound profile and doesn't want you messing with it. If you're someone who likes to fine-tune your audio, that's a pretty significant limitation. 2. You want hi-res audio If hi-res audio is something you actually care about, the Sony WF-1000XM6 have a clear leg up. They support LDAC and LC3 codecs on top of the standard SBC and AAC, which means you can actually stream high-resolution audio over Bluetooth from any compatible source. LDAC, especially, is widely supported on Android devices and across streaming services. Also: Best AirPods: I've used every pair of Apple headphones and earbuds - these are the winnersThe AirPods Pro 3 do technically support lossless audio, but it only works when you're connected to an Apple Vision Pro. For basically every normal listening scenario, like from your iPhone, your Mac, and your iPad, you're stuck with AAC. AAC is a perfectly fine codec for most people. But if you're someone who actively seeks out hi-res content or pays for a lossless streaming tier, the Sony buds are the only pair here that actually lets you take advantage of that in your everyday life. 3. You use non-Apple devices Apple's ecosystem is a major factor in why the AirPods Pro 3 are so appealing. But the moment you're using an Android phone, a Windows PC, or any mix of non-Apple devices, most of what makes the AirPods Pro special just disappears. They'll still function over Bluetooth, sure, but the experience is dramatically stripped down. Also: My simple tweaks that bring dead-sounding headphones back to life - Sony and Bose includedThe Sony WF-1000XM6 don't play favorites. They support Bluetooth 5.3 with Multipoint for two simultaneous connections, and the Sound Connect app works on both iOS and Android with the full feature set either way. You'll get the same EQ, the same control customization, and so on. Really, the only exception is codec support -- you won't get LDAC on iOS devices. You should buy the AirPods Pro 3 if... Jada Jones/ZDNET 1. You want those Apple features If you're already deep in Apple's ecosystem, the AirPods Pro 3 offer a level of integration that no third-party earbud can touch. With them, you'll get automatic switching between your iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple Watch, where the AirPods figure out which device you're actively using and connect to it without you having to do anything. If you use Apple devices, that's significantly more helpful than Bluetooth Multipoint, which limits you to two connections. 2. You want some fitness-tracking features The AirPods Pro 3 have moved into health and fitness in a way that the Sony WF-1000XM6 haven't. Apple has baked heart rate monitoring directly into the earbuds, and they can track workout metrics alongside Apple's Fitness app. There's a hearing health angle, too: the AirPods Pro can run a clinical-grade hearing test and even function as an over-the-counter hearing aid through Apple's Hearing Aid feature. The Sony WF-1000XM6 don't offer anything on the fitness or health-tracking front. Also: Why I still recommend the AirPods Pro 2 in 2026 - especially at this priceIf those capabilities matter to you -- whether it's workout tracking, keeping tabs on your hearing health, or just the broader appeal of consolidating health sensors into devices you're already wearing -- the AirPods Pro 3 are the way to go. These features are still relatively new and somewhat limited compared to a dedicated fitness tracker, but they're a differentiator for Apple's earbuds. 3. You want a more comfortable fit Comfort is always somewhat personal, but the AirPods Pro 3's stem design offers a more meaningfully balanced weight distribution than the Sony WF-1000XM6's bud-style shape. The Sony buds are noticeably bigger than their predecessors, and while Sony says the redesign was meant to better follow the natural shape of your ear, the larger body means they don't sit quite as securely -- particularly when you're moving around. Getting a good fit can take some trial and error, especially with the foam tips. Also: 5 AirPods Pro features that made me ditch my old pair instantly - and how to access themThe stem design also changes how you actually use the earbuds throughout the day. With the AirPods Pro 3, you squeeze the stem to control playback and adjust settings, so you're never pushing anything into your ear canal. With the Sony WF-1000XM6, controls require tapping on the surface of the bud itself, which shoves it deeper into your ear. It's not comfortable, and the tapping sound can be loud. If everyday comfort and ease of use are high on your list, the AirPods Pro 3 have a clear advantage. Writer's choice I prefer the AirPods Pro 3 over the Sony WF-1000XM6 earbuds, largely because of their feature set. I use mostly Apple devices in my day-to-day life, and being able to easily switch between them is hugely helpful. On top of that, I find the AirPods Pro 3 to be more comfortable and more secure in my ears, and I'm often listening to podcasts, where audio customization isn't as important.

Close Home Tech Wearables Headphones The cheap fix that made my AirPods sound so much better Tired of losing your AirPods? These memory foam eartips from Eartune provide a snug fit. Written by David Gewirtz, Senior Contributing EditorSenior Contributing Editor Feb. 12, 2026 at 7:51 a.m. PT David Gewirtz/ZDNETOf all the gear and gadets I own, my AirPods Pro have been the least portable. No, that's not a typo. Let me explain. I loved my first set of AirPods Pro, even after I dropped them into a cup of coffee. They've continued working for more than a year since then. I recently bought a pair of second generation AirPods Pro (and you can still get them for around $210 if you're interested.)Also: Why I still recommend the AirPods Pro 2 in 2026 - especially at this priceMy biggest reason for loving the second-gen AirPods Pro is because of how easily they automatically switch between my various devices. I have two Macs and an iPhone in our family room (which doubles as our work hub), and those AirPods Pro can be connected to any of my active devices in seconds. It's great for productivity.

I also love them because I can wear them (even without any tunes playing) to noise-cancel my little puppy's constant licking. That's a highly repetitive sound that, when heard while trying to concentrate on writing, can be incredibly distracting. Also: Best AirPods 2026: I've used every pair of Apple headphones and earbuds - these are the winnersYou know what I didn't like about my AirPods Pro at first? I couldn't move around with them in. At all. No matter what I did, if I moved my head even a little, the little earbuds always fell out of my ears. Yes, I chose the right size silicone tips and even ran Apple's sound test. But not only couldn't I walk around wearing them, I couldn't really turn my head left or right. Turning my head even slightly to the right caused the right ear pod to drop straight into the trash can that sits next to me.Then I complained about this problem to my wife. So she found me a solution. She does that. It's awesome!She found me a set of memory foam AirPod Pro ear inserts. Unlike the silicone ones that come with the AirPods Pro, the memory foam versions compress to the size and shape of the ear. They also seem to support better sound insulation, but my true happiness is about the fact that they keep my AirPods from falling out.They just stay in my ears. What a relief not to have to fish them out of the trash every time the puppy jumps on me! Also: Which AI tools are worth paying for? Here are subscriptions I'm keeping - and whyBy the way, we did find other memory foam tips for the AirPods Pro, including this set for ten bucks. But the reviews for the set she bought me were better, and they're definitely worth it. I wrote the bulk of this article, then got up and refilled my coffee cup, all without them falling out of my ears. Life changing. It's glorious. I feel so free!

Tech also gets discounted around this time, but you have to do a bit more digging to find actually good deals.

If you don’t want to sort through the mess of bad deals out there, Engadget has you covered. We’re curating the best President Day sales on tech we can find right here. We’ll update this post through the holiday as more deals become available.\nPresidents’ Day deals under $50\n\nDisney+ and Hulu bundle (one month) for $10 ($3 off): You can get one month of Disney+ and Hulu access for only $10 right now. That represents a small savings over the standard $13-per-month price for the bundle, but a 58-percent discount when you compare it to the price of paying for both services separately. It’s a good way to test out the bundle without paying too much before you decide if you want to subscribe for the long haul.\nAnker Nano 45W USB-C charger for $30 ($10 off): Anker’s latest 45W charger has a small smart display on it that can show you real-time charging stats. It’s compact design is great for travel, as are its foldable prongs.\nWaterpik cordless rechargeable water flosser for $40 (20 percent off): A water flosser like this one can make it easier (and less painful in some cases) to floss your teeth on the regular.

The study by the New York Fed found that the majority of tariff costs were passed through to Americans in the first 11 months of 2025, although exporters shouldered an increasing amount as the year progressed. “Our results show that the bulk of the tariff incidence continues to fall on US firms and consumers,” the study’s authors wrote in a blog post on Thursday. “[They] continue to bear the bulk of the economic burden of the high tariffs imposed in 2025.” The Trump administration has insisted that the sweeping tariffs imposed on trading partners during the president’s second term will be paid for by companies looking to export goods into the US. “BILLIONS OF DOLLARS, LARGELY FROM COUNTRIES THAT HAVE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE UNITED STATES FOR MANY YEARS, LAUGHING ALL THE WAY, WILL START FLOWING INTO THE USA,” Trump posted on Truth Social in August 2025, shortly before his so-called “reciprocal tariffs” took effect. However, others in the administration, such as US Treasury secretary Scott Bessent, have acknowledged that US retailers, such as Walmart, have been affected by the decision to raise the levies to levels last seen in the opening decades of the 20th century. Credit: Financial Times Credit: Financial Times The New York Fed study suggested that in the first eight months of the year, 94 percent of the cost had been passed through. This fell slightly to 92 percent in the September to October period and 86 percent in November. “The tariff pass-through into import prices has declined in the latter part of the year. That is, a larger share of the tariff incidence was borne by foreign exporters by the end of the year,” the authors wrote. Other recent studies have made similar findings about the hit to Americans from tariffs. A report by Germany’s Kiel Institute last month found a tariff pass-through rate of 96 percent, while a January study by the National Bureau of Economic Research put the figure at 94 percent. A paper last week from the non-partisan Tax Foundation think tank found that the tariffs amounted to an average tax increase on US households of $1,000 in 2025 and $1,300 in 2026. However, the impact on inflation has been more muted than many economists had feared. The consumer price index fell from 3 percent in January 2025 to 2.7 percent in December. Economists expect it to drop again on Friday, when official figures for January 2026 are released. Over the course of 2025, the average tariff rate on US imports rose from 2.6 percent to 13 percent, according to the New York Fed study. © 2026 The Financial Times Ltd.

Credit: Blizzard Text settings Story text Size Small Standard Large Width * Standard Wide Links Standard Orange * Subscribers only Learn more Minimize to nav It’s not every day that a classic PC game gets a new content expansion 25 years after its last major update. But that’s what happened last night, as Blizzard suddenly released new “Reign of the Warlock” DLC that adds a new class, new end-game challenges, and new inventory-management options to the classic Diablo II. To be clear, the new DLC is technically not for the original 2000 release of Diablo II (which was still getting patches as of 2016) but for the game’s 2021 Resurrected remaster. Still, that remastered version has gameplay and animations that are extremely faithful to the original, making yesterday’s surprise update the kind of content drop that players have been waiting for since 2001’s “Lord of Destruction” expansion. The “Reign of the Warlock” DLC lets you “command forbidden power” as a new class that “wields forbidden arts, bridles hellfire and shadow, and dominates demons,” according to the in-game class selection screen description. By way of backstory, Blizzard writes that most Warlocks “have the means to lead a lavish lifestyle but find the pursuit of luxury and ease stale. Instead, they leverage their elevated status in Sanctuary to hunt down lost knowledge that would enable them to continue the legacy of Horazon.” A new face around a familiar fire. Credit: Blizzard A new face around a familiar fire. Credit: Blizzard The Warlock has a skill tree that has three distinct paths: Demonic: Summon three different types of demons to fight alongside you, then consume those demons to gain powerful boons. Eldritch: Imbue weapons with hexes that cause status effects on foes, and duplicate and throw weapons at enemies. This includes the unique ability to carry a two-handed weapon and an off-hand single weapon at once. Chaos: Throw ranged miasma attacks and gain the ability to summon portals that suck in enemies. The Warlock class is also coming to more recent Diablo games, though players will have to wait a bit for those updates to hit. Diablo IV will get the new class via the previously announced “Lord of Hatred” expansion on April 28, with more details promised for a March 5 Developer Update livestream. Diablo Immortal will also add the Warlock as yet another free-to-play option in a June update. And the rest In addition to the new class, the “Reign of the Warlock” DLC updates the game’s late-game rotating Terror Zones with new options that let you “terrorize” a specific Act. High-level players will also be able to collect statues from bosses that can be combined to summon “a new pinnacle test” in the form of a Colossal Ancient boss. And players on the highest “Hell” difficulty will now have to face down Heralds of Terror that “stalk you as prey.” The Colossal Ancients are a new “pinnacle test” for late game Diablo II: Resurrected players. Credit: Blizzard The Colossal Ancients are a new “pinnacle test” for late game Diablo II: Resurrected players. Credit: Blizzard Blizzard is also introducing a few quality-of-life updates to make D2: Resurrected a little less annoying. A new loot filter helps you sort through drops for specific types of items more quickly, while the ability to stack items inside your Stash Tabs prevents the need to scroll through pages of identical gems. Alongside the DLC announcement, Blizzard revealed the first Steam version of Diablo II Resurrected: an “Infernal Edition” that includes the new Reign of the Warlock DLC for $40. Existing Resurrected owners can also purchase the DLC on its own for $25 on Battle.net or Xbox.

Close Home Home & Office When is Amazon's Big Spring Sale? Rumored dates and everything else we know so far Amazon's annual spring sale is expected to return soon, with plenty of deals on everyone's favorite products. Written by Kayla Solino, EditorEditor Feb. 12, 2026 at 7:32 a.m. PT Adam Breeden/ZDNETIt appears that Amazon's third annual Big Spring Sale will return in 2026, despite the company not yet publicly sharing any dates or details. Early leaks from members of Amazon's Seller Central platform, the web-based dashboard for third-party sellers to manage their business on the Amazon marketplace, detailed preparations for the upcoming sale event. The leaks suggest that Amazon's spring savings event will return from March 25-31 this year.Also: Update your Echo speakers ASAP for Alexa's most functional upgrade in decades - here's howIn a Feb. 10 email, a PR representative for Amazon told ZDNET that we would be informed as soon as information was available. \"While Amazon has not yet made any announcements about this event, we will let you know as soon as we have news to share.\" Amazon did not confirm a 2026 Big Spring Sale, nor did it confirm the rumored dates of March 25-31, but also did not deny it.One Amazon seller posted on LinkedIn on Feb.10, outlining the specific dates for the sale and sharing more details on deal submissions for sellers. The user's LinkedIn post included a screenshot that read \"Amazon is now accepting deals submissions for the Big Spring Sale 2026 event.\" The screenshot also notes that deals must be submitted by March 24, 2026 and that the focus sales categories are outdoor & garden, home, beauty & fashion, pets, travel, and other seasonally applicable categories. Older threads on the Amazon Seller Central from Feb. 12, 2025, detail similar information about deals submissions for the 2025 Big Spring Sale around this same time period last year.According to Bradley Sutton with the AM|PM Podcast, Amazon's Seller Central platform revealed the 2026 sale dates as early as Jan. 30, with some products already being flagged as eligible for Seller Central deals and Lighting Deals then.Also: 15+ powerful Alexa commands you should start using at home (no subscriptions required)Last year, Amazon's second annual Big Spring Sale (commonly known as the Amazon Spring Sale or Spring Deal Days in the UK) also ran from March 25-31. Amazon didn't publicly confirm dates or even announce the 2025 Big Spring Sale until March 18 last year (though I was able to determine last year's sale dates thanks to Seller Central leaks, too), so it's possible we won't see any public details on this year's event anytime soon. As ZDNET's deal connoisseur, I'll be using my extensive hands-on tech experience and seasoned commerce skills to cover upcoming sales and deals. I break down everything you need to know to shop like a pro any time of the year -- plus all of the details about Amazon's likely-upcoming Big Spring Sale. Happy shopping!Discover Amazon's Big Spring SaleWhen does the Amazon Spring Sale start?According to early leaks, Amazon's Big Spring sale starts Wednesday, March 25, 2026, and ends Tuesday, March 31, 2026.My personal estimations placed the Big Spring Sale returning sometime between March 20-31. Amazon has not yet confirmed the return of the sale or specified sale dates, but information on the Amazon Seller Central platform indicates preparations are underway. Like last year (and all of Amazon's other sale events), I anticipate Amazon's Big Spring Sale to start at 12:01 a.m. PST on March 25, or 3:01 a.m. EST if you're on the East Coast like ZDNET. Amazon's sales typically end on the same schedule, with deal events closing at midnight PST on the last day of the sale. What is Amazon's Big Spring Sale?Amazon frequently runs sales several times during the year, and currently has tons of products discounted ahead of Presidents' Day. The company's most popular Prime Day sales occur in October and July. In 2024, Amazon introduced the Big Spring Sale, signaling a new annual event in March on the retail giant's calendar. It was not a Prime-exclusive event. However, like the last two years, expect to see select exclusive Prime member offers. Unlike Prime Day, the spring sale runs for multiple days, not just two. According to early leaks, this year's sale event is March 25-31, 2026. In the UK, the event is called Amazon Spring Deal Days. Essentially, you can expect tons of deals across almost every product category, especially seasonally appropriate areas like outdoor & garden, home, beauty & fashion, and more, all available for a limited time. How long is the Amazon Spring Sale?Amazon's 2026 Big Spring Sale is a multi-day shopping event that will stretch from Wednesday, March 25, to Tuesday, March 31, 2026, according to early rumors. Last year, the Big Spring Sale ran during the same March 25-31 window.What are the dates of Amazon's Big Spring Sale?The dates of Amazon's Big Spring Sale are Wednesday, March 25, to Tuesday, March 31, 2026, according to early leaks. In 2025, the event ran from March 25-31. In 2024, the Big Spring sale ran from March 20-25. Do I have to be a Prime member to shop Amazon's Big Spring Sale?No, you don't have to be a Prime member to shop this sale event. All customers can shop the Amazon Big Spring Sale, although, as in years past, Prime members will presumably have special access to select exclusive deals. If you're not a Prime member yet, you can join before the Big Spring Sale kickoff to receive member benefits like free shipping, entertainment, exclusive savings, and more. Adam Breeden/ZDNETHow much is an Amazon Prime membership?Amazon Prime costs $15 per month, or you can purchase an annual membership for $139, to save several dollars. College students and those aged 18-24 can get a discount via Prime for Young Adults and pay nearly $8 per month or $69 per year. In addition, those with qualified government assistance (which may include select seniors) can receive a Prime membership at a discount.How can I maximize my savings during the Big Spring Sale?As a deals & shopping editor, I can recommend a few tips to help you maximize your sales on Amazon. If you want to shop the sale, you should consider getting a Prime account, even if the Big Spring Sale isn't a Prime-exclusive event. In addition to free two-day shipping, membership is easy to set up and gives you access to exclusive offers on the site. Plus, you can use a free trial to shop for the best savings without spending a dime on a membership. If you end up starting a free trial (or already have Prime), ensure your payment options (like one-click settings and your default delivery address) are correct. This way, you can check out quickly if needed during the sale. Other ways to prepare for spring savings include researching and planning potential purchases, listing want and need items, and setting a budget before sales. When is the next Prime Day?If Amazon sticks to its typical sale calendar, the next Prime Day sale (and the first of 2026) will likely be in July. However, there are still a few more chances to save until then, including during the Big Spring Sale. What types of deals can I find during the Amazon Big Spring Sale?Last year, Amazon promised up to 40% off across 35 categories, including home, fashion, and more. Plus, there were daily deal drops, Prime-exclusive offers, and lots of savings on Amazon Haul, the site's budget shopping experience. Amazon hasn't shared any more details just yet, but we'll let you know when they do. How long will Amazon's Spring Sale deals last?Amazon's Spring Sale presumably runs from March 25 to March 31 this year, so expect multiple days of deals and plenty of opportunities to save. However, as with all sale events, there will be lingering offers from Amazon and competing retailers after the official sale ends, and likely competing sales kicking off even before Amazon's sale does. The ZDNET team will cover the best deals on top-tested tech before, during, and after the Big Spring Sale, so I'll keep you posted. Are other retailers participating in Amazon's Spring Sale?Last year, several retailers jumped on the spring sale train and offered seasonal savings that overlapped with, preceded, or followed Amazon's Big Spring Sale. We saw concurrent sales from other major competitors like Target, Walmart, and Best Buy. Expect many retailers to continue dropping prices to match Amazon's and give customers like you a choice of where to buy.Why trust ZDNET to help you shop?As a member of the ZDNET staff, I only write about deals that I or a team member would want to buy -- devices and products we desire, need, or would recommend.

The Apple Watch Series 11 is on sale for $299 for Presidents' Day, which is $100 off and the lowest price we've seen. A number of other Apple devices are on sale for the holiday as well.\n \nWe named the Apple Watch Series 11 as our choice for best smartwatch overall. It scored a 90 in our review thanks to its 24 hours-plus of battery life and a thin, light design that's easy to wear. It also offers new health metrics, including Apple's hypertension alerts system and Sleep Score. \n \n\n \n \nThe Apple Watch Series 11 deal is available on the 42mm case with a small/medium band. It also only includes GPS and four colorways: the Jet Black and Space Gray aluminum cases with a Black sport band, the Rose Gold aluminum case with a Light Blush sport band and the Silver aluminum case with a Purple Fog sport band.\n \nAmong the other Presidents' Day Apple deals are mostly accessories: there are solid deals on AirPods, AirTags (the first-gen trackers, not the new, second-gen ones), the iPhone Air battery pack and even Apple's new crossbody straps that attach to the company's iPhone cases so you can essentially \"wear\" your iPhone like a bag. As with most Apple first-party accessories, you can find plenty of more affordable, third-party versions of them as alternatives. But if you're keen on outfitting your phone with Apple's own gear, it's best to wait for discounts like these.

Close Home Tech Computing Laptops I found the perfect desktop replacement in this unlikely Dell model - and it's a beast Dell's Alienware m18 R2 is an 18-inch gaming laptop equipped with powerful hardware for high-end gaming. Written by Kyle Kucharski, EditorEditor Feb. 12, 2026 at 7:23 a.m. PT Alienware m18 R2 ZDNET's key takeaways The Alienware m18 R2 is a top-tier gaming laptop available on Amazon for $2,600. It has a commanding presence, is highly customizable, and is powerful enough to handle just about any game you want to play. This is a large, expensive laptop that requires plenty of juice, and it can get quite loud. View now at Amazon Follow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.Weighing nearly nine pounds and measuring 18 inches, Dell's Alienware m18 R2 is a beast. It's big, it's thick, and it probably won't fit in your laptop bag. It just feels powerful, and when you open it up, it looks like a high-end machine. Given its nearly $3,000 price tag, it definitely should. Today's Alienware laptops are a little more grown-up than back in the day. They've left the lime-green aesthetic from the 2010s where it belongs and instead give consumers the option for more subdued exteriors and typical laptop colors. This is a laptop you could definitely take into the office (though it might still attract some looks) and, with the press of one button, turn off all the RGB lighting -- like putting on a suit and tie. Also: This Lenovo laptop has no business being this good for work - when it's made for gamersThat being said, this is absolutely a gaming laptop. As a refresh of last year's m18 r1 model, the R2 is a powerful, top-of-the-line gamer's paradise, stacked with a 14th-generation Intel HX 24-core 5.8 GHz max boost processor, high-end graphics capabilities, a sophisticated cooling system, and more ports than you'll know what to do with. ZDNET RECOMMENDS Alienware m18 R2 The M18 r2 is a top-of-the-line gaming laptop with a commanding presence. details View at Amazon Best laptop deals of the week Dell 15 DC15250 Intel i7 13th Gen 512GB SSD 16GB RAM 15.6-inch Laptop: $430 (save $270) Lenovo ThinkPad E14 Gen 6 Ryzen 7 1TB SSD 16GB RAM 14-inch Laptop: $818 (save $421) Asus Chromebook Plus CX14 Intel 3 128GB SSD 8GB RAM 14-inch Laptop: $249 (save $180) Dell 14 Premium Intel Ultra 7 512GB SSD 16GB RAM 14-inch 2K Laptop (Platinum): $1,000 (save $550) HP OmniBook X Flip Intel Ultra 7 512GB SSD 16GB RAM 16-inch 2K 2-in-1 Laptop: $600 (save $600) Deals are selected by the CNET Group commerce team, and may be unrelated to this article. If you want to go crazy with the RGB lighting, the Alienware Command Center application lets you customize lighting however you like, key by key. There's also a host of settings and configurations that may or may not be useful to the average user, including operation profiles such as \"Performance\", \"Battery\", or \"Quiet\", as well as a clickable MUX switch. This is also where you can overclock your machine. Despite its colossal size, the m18 R2 is very comfortable to use. The touchpad is minimalistic, responsive, and just large enough. The rest of the keyboard's texture is matte black, feeling very luxurious and almost soft to the touch. Also: Looking for a Windows 11 laptop? This Dell checks all the right boxes for meMuch like a desktop, the rear of the laptop is where most of its ports are, including the power jack, an HDMI port, a full-size memory card slot, and two Thunderbolt 4 ports. This part of the laptop also has a statement-making RGB light strip (if you have it turned on) that looks great. Kyle Kucharski/ZDNETThe m18 R2 can come with either a traditional or mechanical keyboard, and I was lucky enough to get my hands on one with the Cherry MX mechanical. It feels exactly as satisfying as you'd expect, with each key getting the proper tactile \"click\" that feels the same no matter where on the key you press, and with a total key-travel distance of 1.8mm. This keyboard isn't exceptionally loud as mechanicals go, but it does make a little more noise than a regular keyboard.The m18 R2's display is commanding. It feels sturdy -- monolithic, even -- and the V-rail edges at its base are framed by the keyboard's bottom plate, making it feel secure yet well-designed and characteristic.Also: How much RAM does your PC really need in 2026? A Windows and Mac expert's opinionThe 16:10, 18-inch panel offers options for 165Hz QHD+ or a blazing 480Hz FHD+ with low-blue-light technology. The screen is not the brightest out there, maxing out at 300 nits, but even at 165Hz, it delivers a very fast, crisp display, free of blurring or motion artifacts. During my testing, I fired up Helldivers 2, and it played like a dream. With the graphics turned up and with a maximum draw distance, it felt immersive and responsive, with minimal lag or stuttering. I noticed slight performance changes when the laptop was plugged in or running on battery, particularly immediately after disconnecting the power adapter, as this seemed to trigger different actions, such as disabling RGB lighting or triggering a performance boost, depending on your settings. Kyle Kucharski/ZDNETSpeaking of battery power, this laptop, as expected, might not be winning any endurance marathons. This is a big machine with 270W of total power, so it's going to work best when it's juiced up. That being said, it seems to be designed with this in mind. When left unplugged and idle, it quickly shuts down non-essentials like lighting and the display. In testing, I unplugged the machine and ran a live stream on YouTube at 50% brightness, and it lasted just short of six hours. The m16 R2 comes with a host of preset multimedia functions bound to the F keys. For example, pressing F1 turns on the laptop's performance boost preset, while pressing F2 instantly turns off all the flashy RGB lighting by activating \"Stealth Mode\". Also: Use multiple monitors? This 11-in-1 docking station is my secret weapon for office productivityPersonally, I have mixed feelings when manufacturers add a host of new capabilities to the keyboard's function keys. Once you learn what they do, they can be convenient. But on the other hand, you have to take the time to figure this out and decide whether you want to keep the presets as-is or customize them.While testing the m18 R2, I tried Guild Wars 2, a game that uses the function keys extensively for gameplay. With the function keys enabled and bound to the multimedia presets, pressing them in the game did nothing: they didn't activate the associated Alienware function (F1 to activate the performance boost, for example), nor were they recognized by the game. This was obviously a problem, as I had to look up how to toggle off the multimedia functionality. Kyle Kucharski/ZDNETYou can do this in the BIOS, but a much easier way is to just press the Function + Esc keys. With it toggled off, you then just press Function + F1 to activate the multimedia function. After they were toggled off, I had no further issues, but again, this comes down to personal preference. As a dedicated gaming machine, this laptop is well-equipped to stay cool; the fans here are no joke. There are four of them that move air through the cooling system efficiently, although they are by no means quiet. I wouldn't say they're unacceptably loud, but they do compete with the sound from the laptop's speakers, so you'll need headphones if you want to hear sound effects clearly while gaming. Also: How to clear your Windows 11 PC cache (and why it makes such a big difference)A total of five vents on the m18 R2 allow for maximum internal airflow. Additionally, the large vapor chamber that houses the CPU and GPU keeps the hottest parts of the machine within a safe temperature range, while the fans expel hot air out through the sides. This hot air can sometimes be felt, for example, when using a mouse, but it wasn't a bother for me, even when the fans were cranking.In fact, one thing I noticed about the m18 R2 is that it never really felt hot to the touch. Both the keyboard and the wrist rest (above where the battery is housed) remained only slightly warm, suggesting that the fans were indeed doing their job effectively, which I'm glad for, given the sound they generate. ZDNET's buying adviceDell's Alienware m18 R2 is right at the top of the line for gaming laptops. This is a powerful machine with a distinct identity that can handle virtually any game you want, with vibrant graphics and blazing-fast speeds, and can even get dressed for the office at the press of a button. However, this is also quite a large laptop, so although it's portable, it isn't exactly carry-and-go, and it isn't a machine that you can leave unplugged for hours at a time. Pricing can easily rise toward the higher end, too, but the cutting-edge technology solidifies the m18 R2 as a laptop that will stand at the top.Featured reviews I spent weeks with Alexa on the Echo Show 11, and it was awesome (until I started fact-checking) Sony LinkBuds Clip vs. Bose QuietComfort Open: This model wins big I replaced my bedroom TV with a $180 Roku projector - and don't regret it I found the Lenovo ThinkPad to rule them all - and its modular RAM changes everything I spent weeks with Alexa on the Echo Show 11, and it was awesome (until I started fact-checking) Sony LinkBuds Clip vs. Bose QuietComfort Open: This model wins big I replaced my bedroom TV with a $180 Roku projector - and don't regret it I found the Lenovo ThinkPad to rule them all - and its modular RAM changes everything Editorial standards Show Comments Log In to Comment Community Guidelines Related The Alienware 16 Aurora is a powerhouse Windows laptop, and it's under $1,000 right now This Acer laptop from last year is proof that you don't need to upgrade in 2026 One of the best Windows laptops for business I've tested isn't a ThinkPad or Dell XPS"

Close Home Home & Office Home Entertainment Streaming & Services Streaming Devices Deal alert: The Samsung Freestyle 2 is 25% off during Presidents' Day sales My favorite projector for movies and gaming is currently $200 off at Amazon heading into Presidents' Day weekend. Written by Allison Murray, Senior EditorSenior Editor Feb. 12, 2026 at 7:09 a.m. PT Allison Murray/ZDNETSamsung Freestyle 2 for $598 (save $200) ZD recommends 3/5 Editor's deal rating View at Amazon Follow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.When it comes to certain tech gadgets, you get what you pay for, and this is true when it comes to projectors. Opting for a cheap projector is just fine, but it won't be as good of a quality resolution or as easy to set up and control as a more expensive one. The Samsung Freestyle 2 projector is an expensive projector at $800, but its high-tech specs and portability understandably justify the price tag. However, this high-quality projector is currently $200 off at Amazon as a Presidents' Day deal.Also: The best Presidents' Day deals we've found so farI personally tried and tested this projector, and it's worth the money--especially when you consider that it also serves as a gaming console. ZD recommends Samsung Freestyle 2 for $598 (save $200) View at Amazon The Freestyle 2 comes with the Samsung Gaming Hub, which allows you to play games just the Freestyle 2, internet access, and game controller. You'll have to subscribe to cloud streaming like Xbox, GeForce Now, Luna, and others, but there are also free games you can play right off the bat.Review: Samsung's latest swiveling projector is secretly the best gaming console you can buyIn my testing, it was a unique experience to be able to play games outside or cast them to our ceiling while lying down without being tied to one specific room or a particular gaming console.Aside from its gaming aspect, the Samsung Freestyle 2 impressed me with both image quality, the ability to auto-focus -- whether it was projecting onto a slanted ceiling or a projector screen -- and the overall experience of setup and streaming. This projector's built-in speakers are also something to be praised: the 5W 360-degree speaker packs a punch, even during a very windy outdoor nighttime streaming of a movie. While expensive, this Presidents' Day deal will get you $200 off, which puts the Samsung Freestyle 2 at just under $600.Find more Presidents' Day dealsHow I rated this dealBased on ZDNET's deal-rating system, I gave this 25% off deal a 3/5 rating. We've seen it at a lower price before, so it isn't the most discounted it's ever been, but $200 off is still a great deal for Presidents' Day. When will this deal expire?

The richest man in the world posted about how the white race was under threat, made allusions to race science or promoted anti-immigrant conspiracy content on 26 out of 31 days in January, according to the Guardian’s analysis of his social media output. The posts, made on his platform X, reflect a renewed embrace of what extremism experts describe as white supremacist material.\n“Whites are a rapidly dying minority,” Musk said on 22 January, a short time before taking the stage at the World Economic Forum in Davos, while reposting an Irish anti-immigrant influencer’s video about demographic change.\n Continue reading...",

    "summary": "You have the best chance to save on streaming services during the holiday shopping season, but throughout the year, the occasional deal pops up that's worth considering. Case in point: this new Disney+ deal. New and eligible returning subscribers can sign up for the Disney+ Hulu bundle (with ads) for $10 for one month of access. That's $3 off the usual price of the bundle for one month, and more than 58 percent off if you consider the cost of each service individually (Disney+ at $12 per month and, separately, Hulu also at $12 per month).\n \nWe'd be remiss if we didn't mention that this isn't quite as good as the Black Friday deal we saw last year, which offered the same bundle for $5 per month for one year. However, if you missed that offer or just want to try out Disney+ and Hulu for a brief period of time, this is a good way to do so.\n \n\n \n \nDisney+ and Hulu make one of the most balanced streaming pairs available, blending family-friendly favorites with acclaimed originals and network TV staples. Disney+ brings a vast library of animated classics, blockbuster franchises and exclusive content from Marvel, Pixar, Star Wars and National Geographic. It’s the place to stream nearly every Star Wars film and series, plus the full Marvel Cinematic Universe lineup and Disney’s most recent theatrical releases.\n \nHulu balances things out with a more adult-oriented lineup of current TV shows, next-day network episodes and a growing roster of award-winning originals. The platform hosts series like The Bear, The Handmaid’s Tale and Only Murders in the Building, alongside comedies, thrillers and documentaries that regularly feature in awards conversations. It’s also the home for next-day streaming of ABC and FX shows, making it especially useful if you’ve already cut the cable cord but still want to keep up with primetime TV.\n \nThe Duo Basic bundle ties these two services together under a single subscription, offering a simple way to expand your library without juggling multiple accounts. This tier includes ads on both platforms, but the trade-off is significant savings compared with paying for each service separately. For many households, that’s an acceptable compromise when it means access to such a wide range of content.\n \nFollow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/the-disney-hulu-bundle-is-down-to-only-10-for-one-month-192814350.html?src=rss",

It also works with the original Fire TV Stick 4K Max if you're running Fire OS 7.7.1.1 or later. \nOn the Fire TV platform, GeForce Now streaming quality tops out at a resolution of 1080p and a frame rate of 60 fps, with SDR visuals, H.264 video encoding and stereo audio.

    "summary": "AirTags are basically an essential accessory for iPhone users who want to keep track of things like their keys, wallet and backpack. While it's easy enough to replace the battery in both versions of the AirTag, you may not want to have to rush to do so at the end of the battery's roughly two-year lifespan. That's where Elevation Lab's extended battery case for the AirTag comes in, and it's heavily discounted right now: it's 30 percent off and down to $16.\n \nThe case usually sells for $23, so that's a 30 percent discount. It's not the first time we've seen this deal, but it's a pretty decent one all the same.\n \n\n \n \nThis is arguably one of the more useful AirTag accessories around for certain use cases. It won't exactly be helpful for an AirTag that you put in a wallet or attach to your keys, as it's too bulky for such a purpose — and it doesn't have a hole for a keyring anyway. Still, if you're looking for an AirTag case that you can place in a suitcase or backpack and not have to touch for years, this could be the ticket.\n \nElevation Lab says that, when you place a couple of AA batteries in the case, it can extend the tracker's battery life to as much as 10 years (the brand recommends using Energizer Ultimate Lithium batteries for best results). The AirTag is slated to run for over a year on its standard CR2032 button cell. \n \nThe case gives the AirTag more protection as well. It's sealed with four screws and it has a IP69 waterproof rating. What's more, it doesn't ostensibly look like an AirTag case, so someone who steals an item with one inside is perhaps less likely to realize that the object they pilfered is being tracked.\n \nThere are some other downsides, though. Since the AirTag is locked inside a case, the sound it emits will be muffled. Elevation Lab says the device's volume will be about two-thirds the level of a case-free AirTag. However, the second-gen AirTag is louder than its predecessor, which should mitigate that issue somewhat.\n \n\n \n \n\n \n \nFollow @EngadgetDeals on X for the latest tech deals and buying advice.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/get-elevation-labs-10-year-extended-battery-case-for-airtag-for-only-16-for-presidents-day-151215232.html?src=rss",

That brings the Premium tier down to $10 per month when billed yearly, while the Plus and Standard plans are also discounted to $8 monthly and $5 monthly, respectively. Each tier unlocks the full catalog of classes, with the main differences coming down to how many devices can stream at once and whether offline viewing is included.\nThere are more than 200 classes on MasterClass now, and many are led by big names at the top of their fields. Depending on your interests, you might pick up cooking tips from Gordon Ramsay, learn storytelling from Margaret Atwood, explore business strategy with Richard Branson or get insights into performance and mindset from athletes and entertainers. The catalog spans everything from film and TV to wellness, music, science, leadership and photography, so it’s easy to dip in and find something that holds your attention.\n\nOver the years, MasterClass has expanded into a broad learning platform that feels like part streaming service and part educational library. The catalog spans categories like food, film, music, wellness, sports and entrepreneurship, with lessons designed to be short and easy to follow. Since every plan includes access to the full course library, the choice mostly comes down to convenience. The Standard tier supports one device and doesn’t include offline mode, the Plus plan allows streaming on two devices with downloads, and the Premium tier increases that to six devices with offline access as well.\nClasses are structured to be approachable whether you want to learn a new skill or just explore a topic out of curiosity. Lessons are broken into bite-sized segments, so it’s easy to watch one or two at a time on a commute or in the evening. Members also get access to a global community, occasional newsletters and the ability to switch between video and audio listening on supported classes.\nIf you’ve been considering trying MasterClass, this deal makes it a more affordable way to see if it works for you. A subscription can also double as a thoughtful gift, which is one reason it has appeared in Engadget’s roundup of the best subscription gifts to send to loved ones. With the current 50 percent discount applied across all tiers, it’s a relatively low-cost way to get access to a large library of professionally produced courses that you can watch at your own pace throughout the year.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/deals/masterclass-deal-get-half-off-subscriptions-ahead-of-presidents-day-130500563.html?src=rss",

Close Home Innovation Artificial Intelligence This free MacOS app is the secret to getting more out of your local AI models You should consider using Reins if you're a fan of using local LLMs on MacOS. Written by Jack Wallen, Contributing WriterContributing Writer Feb. 12, 2026 at 4:57 a.m. PT Screenshot by Jack Wallen/ZDNETFollow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.ZDNET's key takeawaysReins is a free GUI frontend for Ollama.The system only works on MacOS.Reins includes features not found in other GUIs.When I need to use AI, my first choice is always local for privacy reasons, and most of the time it's via Ollama. I can use Ollama's command-line tools just fine, but certain features in various GUIs enhance and simplify the experience. Although Ollama has its own well-designed and user-friendly GUI, it's a bit bare-bones for me.Also: 5 reasons I use local AI on my desktop - instead of ChatGPT, Gemini, or ClaudeAnother option is Reins, which empowers researchers and hobbyists with total control over self-hosted models. Reins has plenty of features, such as remote model access, per-chat system prompts, prompt editing and regeneration, image integration, advanced configuration, model selection, model creation from prompts, multiple chat management, dynamic model switching, and real-time message streaming.Also: I tried a Claude Code rival that's local, open source, and completely free - how it wentAll of those features come together to make Reins my new go-to for working with Ollama local LLMs.Let's install Reins and see how some of those more important features work.Installing ReinsWhat you'll need: Reins is a free, MacOS-only app, so if you're using Linux or Windows, you'll have to turn to another GUI (such as the official Ollama app or Alpaca). To use Reins, you'll need Ollama installed (download the installer from the official site) and, of course, a Mac. You can connect Reins to an Ollama instance on another machine on your LAN, or you can install Ollama on the machine that will host Reins. 1. Open the App Store Reins is in the Apple App Store, so open that app from either Launchpad or your Dock. Show more 2. Locate Reins Search for Reins from within the App Store. Show more 3. Install Reins To install Reins, click the Get button and allow the installation to start and finish. Show more That's it for the installation.Using ReinsReins is very simple to use. Once you open the app, you'll see it has connected to Ollama.Also: I stopped using ChatGPT for everything: These AI models beat it at research, coding, and moreWhen you type your initial prompt, you'll be prompted to select a model. Once you've selected your model, you can submit your prompt, and Reins will do its thing: The Reins GUI is very easy to use. Screenshot by Jack Wallen/ZDNETOne of the coolest features of Reins is that you can switch models on the fly. To do that, click the model name at the top (under the Reins title) and select the model you want to use. While Ollama is working on one prompt, you can select a previous prompt, switch models, and continue working. You don't get that kind of flexibility with some Ollama GUIs: Switch models on the fly by clicking the name drop-down under Reins. Screenshot by Jack Wallen/ZDNETYou can even add files to your queries by clicking + directly to the left of the prompt field. The only caveat to this feature is that it is limited to image upload. Also: 5 ways you can stop testing AI and start scaling it responsibly in 2026If you have a text document, you can copy and paste it into the query field. When you do that, Reins will use whatever model you've selected to summarize the material.One helpful feature (that doesn't work… yet)There is one feature that had me excited to use Reins, even though it is currently failing me.Let's say I've spent quite a while on a single prompt, doing follow-up questions, adding research and images, and more. I might spend a week working on that research. When I feel the research is complete, I can save it as a model for later queries. To save a prompt as a model, select the prompt from the sidebar, then click the Settings icon in the top-right of the Reins window. In the resulting pop-up, click \"Save as a new model,\" which will open a new pop-up that requires a name: Hopefully, the Save as model feature will work in future releases. Screenshot by Jack Wallen/ZDNETI've been trying to get this feature to work, but it keeps failing. I even jokingly asked Reins why the feature wasn't working and, to my surprise, it actually offered some helpful advice. Sadly, the suggestions did not work. Also: 5 ways rules and regulations can help guide your AI innovationI reached out to the developer to see if there was a solution. He responded with, \"I will investigate it, and also I am going to release a new update to improve errors to show the exact error message soon. I'll let you know when I fix it.\"That's reassuring. Despite that one (temporarily) broken feature, I've found Reins to be an outstanding frontend for Ollama. Although I'm also a fan of the terminal version of Ollama, I like a good GUI. If you use MacOS, I would suggest you give this one a try.Featured Your PC's critical security certificates may be about to expire - how to check 5 Linux servers that let you ditch the public cloud and reclaim your privacy - for free Is spyware hiding on your phone?

    "summary": "Apple’s long-delayed AI-powered Siri redesign may not be rolling out this year, at least in the way the company had planned. According to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, Apple found problems with its software upon testing, such as the virtual assistant taking too long to accomplish tasks or even not processing queries properly altogether. Siri’s new version was also reportedly so sluggish during testing that its developers believed Apple would have to push back its launch by months. Instead of releasing the redesigned assistant in March as was previously reported, Gurman says Apple will roll out its capabilities piecemeal over future software updates. \nThe company originally unveiled the redesigned Siri back in 2024, promising an AI-powered assistant that can do tasks for you, such as finding specific photos or tracking details, adding information to contact cards, editing photos and sharing note summaries to be sent as emails. It was slated to make its way to iOS users in 2025, but Apple announced that year that it was going to be delayed. “It’s going to take us longer than we thought to deliver on these features and we anticipate rolling them out in the coming year,” the company said. Bloomberg reported back then that the new AI-infused Siri was going to be included in a planned iOS 26.4 update due in March instead. Based on this latest report, however, we might only get a portion of Siri’s new capabilities next month. More capabilities could be released with iOS 26.5  in May and with iOS 27 later this year.\nIn January this year, Apple confirmed reports that Google’s Gemini models will help power the new Siri. “After careful evaluation, Apple determined that Google's Al technology provides the most capable foundation for Apple Foundation Models and is excited about the innovative new experiences it will unlock for Apple users,” the company said in a statement. The revamped assistant is expected to behave like an AI chatbot, similar to OpenAI's ChatGPT, when it does become available. \nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/mobile/apples-siri-relaunch-is-reportedly-behind-schedule-125347471.html?src=rss",

Written by Maria Diaz, Staff WriterStaff Writer Feb. 12, 2026 at 4:30 a.m. PT OnePlus Pad Go 2 ZDNET's key takeaways The OnePlus Pad Go 2 is a midrange Android tablet available starting at $399. As an affordable tablet, the Pad Go 2 has a large 12.1 display with nearly 3K resolution and around 900 nits of brightness. The OnePlus Pad Go 2 outperforms more expensive tablets, but don't expect it to outperform an iPad. View now at Oneplus Follow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.Even as an affordable Android tablet, the OnePlus Pad Go 2 has proven to be a capable entertainment and productivity tablet without the flagship pricing. It's one of the best value tablets I've used recently, and it gets even better when you add the native accessories, such as the OnePlus stylus and folio case.Also: Need a rugged Android tablet for your business? I tested one that looks great and lasts all dayAs you can probably tell by its name, the OnePlus Pad Go 2 is the successor to the brand's previous affordable tablet, launched last year, though it features some significant upgrades. The Pad Go 2 features a larger display this year, a 12.1-inch screen with a 7:5 aspect ratio that works well for multitasking, streaming videos, and reading. ZDNET RECOMMENDS OnePlus Pad Go 2 The OnePlus Pad Go 2 is the successor to the brand's affordable line of tablets, running Android-based OxygenOS 16. details View at OnePlus Best tablet deals of the week Samsung Galaxy Tab A9 Plus 64GB Wi-Fi 11-inch Tablet (Graphite): $149 (save $71) Apple iPad 11-inch 128GB Wi-Fi Retina Tablet (Blue, 2025 Release): $274 (save $75) Samsung Galaxy Tab S6 Lite 128GB Wi-Fi Tablet (Oxford Gray): $230 (save $170) Amazon Fire HD 10 32GB Tablet (2023 Release, Black): $70 (save $70) Amazon Fire Max 11 128GB Wi-Fi Tablet (2023 Model): $190 (save $90) Deals are selected by the CNET Group commerce team, and may be unrelated to this article. The tablet looked sleek and imposing when I unboxed it, especially after getting used to the 11-inch iPad Pro for everyday work. However, the OnePlus Pad Go 2 remains compact enough to accompany you to work, school, or travel, without weighing down your backpack or shoulder bag like a laptop would.Also: Why I travel with this $200 Android tablet more than my iPad - and don't regret itAs an entertainment tablet, the Pad Go 2 performs exceptionally well, particularly when compared to other Android tablets in its price range. It can be an all-day device with a long battery life, making it easy to transition from work to streaming or gaming. Maria Diaz/ZDNETI used the OnePlus Pad Go 2 to write and edit my content for over two months as it paired well with a Bluetooth keyboard, and I wasn't the least bit disappointed with its performance. However, I found it a bit slow for video editing, with occasional app crashes, though not many.

The OnePlus Pad Go 2 is one of the best budget-friendly, everyday-use tablets, especially for loyal Android users.Also: I stopped using a dedicated e-reader when I found out my tablet could do this insteadThat said, if you primarily work with messaging, email, writing, or editing content, it's a near-perfect on-the-go device. Even though Apple is renowned for its display quality and color grading, the OnePlus Pad Go 2's 2.8K display is surprisingly vibrant and sharp. It's decently bright, capable of reaching up to 900 nits, although it falls slightly short in sunny outdoor environments. The OnePlus Pad Go 2 has its own stylus (sold separately for $80), the OnePlus Pad Go 2 Stylo. Maria Diaz/ZDNETThe vibrancy and intensity of this tablet's realistic colors made it easy to reach for it more often than my iPad to stream content. The tablet's speakers are surprisingly powerful, which is a big compliment for a tablet in this price range.Aside from my Bluetooth keyboard, I got to test the Pad Go 2 with the OnePlus Pad Go 2 Stylo and was surprisingly satisfied with its performance, especially as someone who uses styluses from different brands. I have to say, I've been very satisfied replacing the iPad Air, which was my go-to tablet for months, with the Pad Go 2 for work and entertainment. Also: How to clear your iPad cache (and wipe out lag for good)This OnePlus tablet has been reliable and perfect for multitasking, which is my biggest pain point with tablets. Even the $300 base model iPad doesn't multitask as consistently as this Android tablet, which experienced fewer app crashes than the Pad Go 2. I've tested various tablets, ranging from e-paper to full-color displays, in both matte and glossy finishes, for note-taking and drawing. Since each brand tends to have its own stylus, that means I've also tested many electronic pencils and styluses. Also: 9 essential iPadOS 26 features that convinced me to put my MacBook away for goodThe Go 2 Stylo was very responsive and accurate on the tablet and was designed to work with the Pad Go 2. It also has a similar weight and feel to the Apple Pencil Pro, so it's heavier than a Samsung S Pen. The added weight gives you a sense of control when wielding a pen for drawing, which a lot of graphic artists appreciate. Unfortunately, the Go 2 Stylo doesn't support wireless charging and features a USB-C port for recharging. ZDNET's buying advice Maria Diaz/ZDNETThe OnePlus Pad Go 2 is built for the Android user who doesn't want to be a victim of Samsung's premium pricing but wants a comparable device that can actually outperform most other tablets in this price range. As a professional, I've used it every day with ease for work and entertainment, and it can handle both as long as you are aware of its processing limitations -- don't expect to edit long 4K videos without hiccups. Also: The best Samsung tablets of 2026: Expert tested and reviewedHowever, this tablet can also be exceedingly useful for other audiences, from college students who need more versatility and portability than the average Chromebook to older users who prefer a lightweight device they can rely on for various purposes. I used the Pad Go 2 Stylo for illustration and graphic design, and it was as close to the iPad Air with Apple Pencil Pro experience as you can get.If you're an Apple user looking for a more affordable tablet, however, I'd recommend the base model iPad 11, which is at least $50 cheaper.Featured reviews I spent weeks with Alexa on the Echo Show 11, and it was awesome (until I started fact-checking) Sony LinkBuds Clip vs. Bose QuietComfort Open: This model wins big I replaced my bedroom TV with a $180 Roku projector - and don't regret it I found the Lenovo ThinkPad to rule them all - and its modular RAM changes everything I spent weeks with Alexa on the Echo Show 11, and it was awesome (until I started fact-checking) Sony LinkBuds Clip vs. Bose QuietComfort Open: This model wins big I replaced my bedroom TV with a $180 Roku projector - and don't regret it I found the Lenovo ThinkPad to rule them all - and its modular RAM changes everything Editorial standards Show Comments Log In to Comment Community Guidelines Related I lived with this 25-inch Android tablet for a week - and it went surprisingly well Need a rugged Android tablet for your business?

I found 10 proven ways to fix your internet this weekend (most are free) I spent a weekend tweaking my home network to improve my Wi-Fi speed and connectivity. Here's what worked. Written by Steven Vaughan-Nichols, Senior Contributing EditorSenior Contributing Editor Feb. 12, 2026 at 4:28 a.m. PT Reviewed by Elyse Betters Picaro Maria Diaz/ZDNETFollow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.ZDNET's key takeawaysCheck your incoming Internet before fooling with your network.There are simple steps you can take to speed up your Wi-Fi network.To get the most from your network, you'll need to fine-tune its settings.Even with a Netgear Orbi 970 mesh Wi-Fi network, backed by a 2Gbps AT&T fiber-optic Internet connection, I sometimes have Wi-Fi slowdowns. That's because my home has two buildings. One's primarily an office, while the other is where I lay my head. The former is a new 1,000-square-foot building, while the latter is a 3,000-square-foot historic building with its characteristic thick walls, typical of older homes. It's not easy to cover all that space, even with top-of-the-range network gear.Also: What is Wi-Fi 8? And why speed isn't your primary concern with the latest standardEarlier this fall, things started to go wrong -- the way they always do -- so I spent a weekend rebuilding and improving my network. Here's what I did. You probably don't face the kind of trouble I did, but these tips will help anyone get faster, more reliable Wi-Fi.1. Speedtest your internetBefore you can improve your Wi-Fi network, you need to know what you're working with. Sure, your ISP may tell you you're getting 500Mbps of bandwidth, but are you? You can simply type \"speed test\" into your browser, and Chrome, Edge, and Firefox will all run a speed test from there. These are not particularly accurate, especially when you're dealing with speeds above 100Mbps. Instead, I recommend using Ookla Speedtest. (Now Ziff Davis, ZDNET's parent company, owns Ookla, but I'd recommend them anyway.)Also: Eero's new backup device keeps you online when your ISP fails - here's how it worksKeep in mind that when you look at the results, your download speed is what most people care about the most. In particular, if your internet connection is cable or DSL, the download speed will be much faster than the upload speed.You should also recall that your connection is only as fast as the slowest link in your network. For instance, if you have a 1Gbps fiber connection but your PC is connected to it via an outdated 100Mbps Ethernet switch, you won't be able to break the 100Mbps speed limit. If you're consistently not getting the speed you're paying for, it's time to call your ISP. Perhaps you have a Wi-Fi speed issue, or maybe you don't, but you won't know until you're getting the most from your external network. Fast enough. sjvn2. Upgrade your hardware To repeat myself, always remember that your network is only as fast as your slowest link. So, for example, if you have a 300 Mbps cable internet connection, there's no point in upgrading your Wi-Fi access point (AP) or mesh to Wi-Fi 7. It's a different story, though, if you have a Gigabit or better internet hookup. Then, you do look into, say, a Netgear Orbi Wi-Fi 7 or Amazon Eero Outdoor 7 mesh setup. Or, if you don't need a mesh because a single AP will cover your home, then consider an Asus RT-BE86U or TP-Link BE3600. However, once more, keep in mind that Wi-Fi 7 will only work well for you if your computer supports it. If it can't understand the Wi-Fi 7 signal, your older gear will still be able to use the network because it's backward compatible, but you won't get its fastest speed. Also: Are wind power generators actually viable at home? I tried one, and the results blew me awayYou don't have to buy a new computer to get Wi-Fi 7 speeds. There are external Wi-Fi dongles, such as the Asus RT-BE58 Go or Acer Wave D7, that you can plug into an available USB port to get Wi-Fi 7 speeds.If you're running an older router, and your computers support it, you may also get a speed surge by upgrading to a router that supports Wi-Fi 6 or Wi-Fi 6E. With 6E, you can get up to 1Gbps, which is as much throughput as most people will ever need. It still won't be as fast as Wi-Fi 7 equipment, but it will also be cheaper. 3. Keep your firmware updated Even if you don't need or want to buy new Wi-Fi hardware, it's always a good idea to upgrade the firmware of your router, devices, and adapters. Besides improving their security, it may also boost your speed. Also: Should you upgrade to Wi-Fi 7? Here's my verdict after testing this next-gen router at homeYou should also sign up for email alerts from your router's manufacturer to get notified when updates are available. 4. Consider router placement Whether you're using a mesh Wi-Fi network or not, you should place your Wi-Fi router in a central, elevated location with as few walls and physical obstructions as possible between the router and workspaces. With a mesh, make sure there's as clear a sight line as possible between the router and its satellites. Of course, you can't do that in all cases. After all, most people use meshes because they need Wi-Fi coverage on different floors or in far-distant rooms. You should also avoid closets, corners, and spots near large metal appliances. All these can interfere with signals. Also: Should you upgrade your Wi-Fi router to mesh? I compared both for months, and here's my pickI highly recommend keeping your Wi-Fi gear away from cordless phones and baby monitors. These devices tend to interfere with Wi-Fi. Oh, and never, and I mean never, set one up near a microwave. When microwaves are on, they roar with 2.5GHz interference. It's a great mesh network if you can afford it, and you have the right gear to make the best of it. Steven Vaughan-Nichols/ZDNETYou may also want to consider using an Ethernet cable and an Ethernet router or switch to connect your router to its satellites or computers. For example, I had been using a 6GHz backhaul between my mesh router and the mesh satellite that was closest to the other building and its satellites. Now, 6GHz can deliver a very fast signal. In ideal conditions, it can provide over 9Gbps. But its range and ability to go through walls are minimal. You're best off using it to connect devices within a single room. So, instead of using the 6GHz to connect them, I replaced it with a Cat 6 Ethernet cable via a Zyxel 2.5 Gigabit Switch MG-108. The net result? At the far end of my mesh network, I boosted my speed by 100Mbps. 5. Optimize antennas While you're at it, if your routers have external antennas, point them in different directions. At least, make one perpendicular to another. That is, place one horizontally and the other vertically. For me, this reminds me of when I was a kid and we had to move the TV's rabbit-ear antennas to get the best signal. That was a long time ago, but the technique still works. 6. Adjust channels and bands As I sit here at my office desk, my default Wi-Fi analyzer app, the open-source WiFi Analyzer, tells me that, not counting my networks, there are 14 Wi-Fi networks near me. That may sound like a lot, but if you live in an apartment or have an office, that's nothing. All those routers are fighting for the same limited amount of spectrum space. Most modern Wi-Fi routers, including those from TP-Link, Asus, Netgear, Ubiquiti, Acer, and most mesh systems, support automatic channel selection. That means they scan for the least congested channel and switch to it. Also: This Wi-Fi 7 router solved my big internet headache - and it's accessibly pricedHowever, and this is important, most of them only do this when you first turn them on. So, if you're seeing a lot of APs all camping on your default channel, you may want to turn your router off and on to find a less crowded channel for your network. Advanced mesh or enterprise gear uses protocols such as Dynamic Channel Selection (DCS), Automatic Channel Selection (ACS), or Dynamic Channel Assignment (DCA) to automatically scan for the best channels.Many APs also allow you to set channels manually so that you can set them yourself. Typically, you do this in the router menu under \"Advanced\" or \"Wireless\" settings. Mesh networks, however, usually don't allow you to do this, as you'd be juggling three or more Wi-Fi devices. Even if you can do it on your mesh network, I've found it to be more trouble than it's worth. Also: How I upgraded my home Wi-Fi with a VPN-ready router (and why it makes such a big difference)Whenever possible, use the 5GHz range. While everything supports 2.4GHz, and it can cover the longest distance, that also means it's the most crowded section of bandwidth. Besides, you'll get faster traffic on the 5GHz and 6GHz ranges. 7. Test your network If you've done all this, and your signal strength is still weak in certain spots, or even if you have dead spots, you may want to map your Wi-Fi signal with a program that can generate a heat map. The best of these programs is NetSpot, but if you're not already network savvy, you'll probably find it too complicated. If you want a simple program to find your Wi-Fi cold spots, I recommend WiFi Heatmap. It's easy to use, and it's good enough to be useful. Also: Does your old PC need a speed boost? This thumb-sized accessory did the trick for meOnce you've spotted these, if there aren't too many, you may want to add wireless repeaters or additional APs. These devices help rebroadcast the primary signal to cover distant areas. Just make sure that when you buy these, they're compatible with your AP. That usually means getting them from the same vendor.Finally, if you have a large area to cover, it's time to switch to a mesh network. Check your network every now and then to make sure every device on your network is supposed to be on it. In this case, everything is good. Yes, even the Windows 11 PC. sjvn8. Monitor your network I'm not asking you to be a network administrator. Still, you should use your built-in router software or third-party management tools, such as Ubiquiti WiFiman or InSSIDer, to check on your Wi-Fi usage and identify bottlenecks or unauthorized devices. Also: My internet went down - but this TV USB port trick made the outage more bearableFor instance, perhaps the reason you're not getting all the speed you're paying for is that a neighbor is piggybacking on your bandwidth so he and a bunch of his buddies can play Call of Duty: Warzone all night long. 9. Fine-tune your network Fair warning: These tips require you to be comfortable getting your hands dirty with your network's advanced controls. Let's start with prioritizing your video calls, Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP), gaming, and streaming by adjusting your Quality of Service (QoS) settings. QoS gives you the ability to prioritize specific types of network traffic, applications, or devices, ensuring optimal performance for critical services. Also: Your Samsung phone has a secret Wi-Fi menu that's incredibly useful - how to access itWhile higher-end routers do this automatically, most routers require you to turn on QoS features manually. For example, while my Orbi automatically turns on Wi-Fi Multimedia (WMM) QoS, which prioritizes voice, video, and gaming traffic, if I want more precise control, I need to manage it myself. If your router supports beamforming, you should enable it. Beamforming directs the Wi-Fi signal toward specific devices rather than broadcasting it equally in all directions. This targeted transmission improves speed, reliability, and range. You may also want to disable 20/40MHz Coexistence on the 2.4GHz band. This forces your Wi-Fi network to always use a 40MHz channel. This increases potential wireless speed, but this also comes with trade-offs. 40MHz use can dramatically increase interference with your neighbors' 2.4GHz Wi-Fi hardware. I recommend you only use it if there are few other APs in your neck of the woods. Also: I switched my high-end Wi-Fi 7 router to a more affordable option - and don't regret itAnother problem is that older 2.4GHz Wi-Fi equipment may not work well, or at all, with 40MHz channels. While you're at it, you can enable short preamble to improve network speed. This works exceptionally well on modern Wi-Fi devices because it reduces the amount of overhead in each data packet, allowing for faster transmission and higher throughput. So what is it? The preamble is the bit sequence at the start of a Wi-Fi packet that's used for synchronization and channel estimation. However, if you have a lot of older devices or high interference, sticking with long preamble provides better error correction and stability. Me? I use short all the time. It's just faster. 10. Schedule regular checksJust like security, keeping your Wi-Fi up to speed is a never-ending job. You should routinely check Wi-Fi speed with online speed tests and local signal analysis tools. I wish I could say I check it monthly. I don't. Instead, like most of you, I usually wait until something goes awry before fixing up my network. Still, do try to check your network out occasionally. I really had better plans for my weekend than to spend it fiddling with my network. Also: The Wi-Fi mesh system that's perfect for big homes (and deep pockets)Finally, over time, you'll end up buying newer and faster networking gear. When you do that, it's an ideal time to give your network a checkup.

Written by Jack Wallen, Contributing WriterContributing Writer Feb. 12, 2026 at 4:26 a.m. PT Jack Wallen / Elyse Betters Picaro / ZDNETFollow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.ZDNET's key takeawaysEnabling Linux support on Android has several benefits.With this feature, you can create and run bash scripts.This is very handy for learning the ins and outs of scripts.Bash scripts are a great way to automate all sorts of repetitive tasks -- you can run backups, clear temporary files/logs, rename or batch-rename files, install or update software, and much more. Although writing such scripts isn't nearly as hard as you might think, it does take some time to learn the ins and outs of bash scripting.Also: 6 hidden Android features that are seriously useful (and how they made my life easier)Good news: If you have an Android device, you can enable the Linux terminal, which means you can create or practice your bash scripting on the go. If that sounds like something you'd like to try out, keep reading to learn more about writing Linux bash scripts on Android.How to write Linux bash scripts on your AndroidWhat you'll need: The only thing you'll need for this is an Android device with the Linux environment enabled. You can find out how to do this in my article, \"How to use the new Linux terminal on your Android device - it's easy.\"With the Linux terminal ready, let's start our bash script journey.Installing nanoHere are the steps for installing the nano editor, which you'll use to create/modify your bash scripts. 1. Open the terminal app Open your App Drawer and search for the launcher labeled \"Terminal.\" Show more 2. Update Linux Before you can install nano, you have to first update Linux. To do this, type the following command in the terminal: Show more sudo apt updateAfter that command completes, upgrade with:sudo apt upgrade 3. Install nano You can now install the nano editor with the command: Show more sudo apt install nanoAfter that, you're ready to go.Creating your first scriptCreating a basic Linux bash script is actually quite easy. Let's create a script that simply prints \"Hello, ZDNET\" in the terminal. To do this, issue the command:nano hello.shYou should now see an empty file ready for content. The first line of any Bash script is:#!bin / bashNote: Make sure to remove the spaces on either side of the / character.Also: How to clear your Android phone cache (and wipe out lag for good)What the above line does is ensure the script is run via the Bash shell.The next line will be:echo \"Hello, ZDNET\"Save and close the file by tapping Ctrl and then tap x on the keyboard. When prompted, type y, then tap Enter. Next, you need to give the script executable permission with the command:chmod u+x hello.shLet's run our script and see what happens, which is done with:./hello.shYou should see \"Hello, ZDNET\" in the output.Let's write a more useful script. We'll create a script that removes files from the /tmp directory. Although you should really let the system handle this, the script is a good intro for those new to the task.Create the file with:nano delete.shAs usual, the first line is the same as it was in the above script. The main line of the script is then:rm -rf /tmp/*.*Save and close the file. Give the new script executable permission with:chmod u+x delete.shYou can now run this file with:sudo ./delete.shYou have to use sudo because changing anything within /tmp requires admin privileges. If you look in /tmp, you'll find it's now empty.Also: The first 8 Linux commands every new user should learnRemember, although the above method of removing files isn't the normal route, it's a good way to learn. Let's create a backup with a script that requires user input. Create a new file named input.sh. In that file, place the same starting line at the top and then add the following:read -p \"Enter your name: \" nameecho \"Hello, $name! Welcome to ZDNET.\"Save and close the file. After giving the new script executable permissions (chmod u+x input.sh), run the command (./input.sh), and you'll see the output with the name you typed.Keep this in mindRemember, you're using Linux on Android, so I wouldn't consider this a viable way to manage your Android device. However, it's a great way to learn how to write bash scripts for Linux.However, I'd like to add an asterisk to the above caveat. You can access some of the Android directory structure, specifically, /mnt/shared. In that directory, you'll find sub-directories of some of the apps you've installed on your devices. For example, one directory is /mnt/shared/Pictures. Let's say you want to create a script to empty that directory. That script starts with the same first line as always, and adds the following:sudo rm /mnt/shared/Pictures/*.*Also: My 8 must-use Linux commands, and how they can make your life easierSo, yes, creating Bash scripts on Android could be useful (other than for education). However, please do be careful when using Bash scripts in the Android directory. It's fine to use them in the Linux environment, because you can always disable Linux support and re-enable it to start all over. If you messed up the Android file structure, you might have to do a factory reset. You don't want that.

Here are the top adjustments I use to make it a pro tool. Written by David Gewirtz, Senior Contributing EditorSenior Contributing Editor Feb. 12, 2026 at 4:24 a.m. PT Elyse Betters Picaro / ZDNETFollow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.ZDNET's key takeawaysAppearance and response style tweaks improve daily usability.New ad controls let free and Go users limit personalization.Memory and history toggles shape privacy and better context.ChatGPT has come a long way since its introduction in 2022. Usually, when we discuss improvements, we talk about how the AI model has gotten better, safer, and smarter.But if you deconstruct the name ChatGPT, you're left with \"chat\" and \"GPT,\" where GPT means generative, pre-trained transformer (that's the AI part). Today, we're going to dig into the chat side, because ChatGPT has become a far more full-featured AI chat app than it was back when it first launched. Also: I tried a Claude Code rival that's local, open source, and completely free - how it wentI'm using ChatGPT in Chrome on my desktop. But many of the tips I'm going to share with you work in both the standalone ChatGPT apps and the mobile versions. Also, I'll show you some settings available only in the free and Go plan tiers, and others available in the Plus and above tiers. Let's first start with settings and how to get to them. Accessing settings You can access your settings by tapping your account name in the lower-left corner of your screen. Notice there are menu items for Personalization and Settings. Screenshot by David Gewirtz/ZDNETThese both go to the same settings panel. The only difference is that Settings opens the General tab, while Personalization opens the Personalization tab. Screenshot by David Gewirtz/ZDNETDid these need to be two menu items? No, not really. But the OpenAI folks are probably spending a lot more time talking to machines than to real people.1. Customize appearance You can customize the appearance of your chat experience via the General tab of the Settings screen. Screenshot by David Gewirtz/ZDNETYou can choose whether you want dark or light mode (shown at 1). I have mine set to System, so if I switch my Mac to dark mode, ChatGPT's interface will change as well. One of the smaller quality-of-life features is the accent color (shown at 2). I changed mine to green, so my prompts stand out nicely from the AI's responses. 2. Choose your model A very powerful feature available to Plus users and above is the ability to choose the model ChatGPT uses. You can turn this on in the Show Additional Models toggle on the General tab (shown at 3 in the screenshot above). Once you turn on Show Additional Models, you'll be able to access the drop-down model picker from the upper left of the chat window. Screenshot by David Gewirtz/ZDNETWhen ChatGPT releases a new model, I often go up to this menu and choose the model I've been most recently using from the legacy list. For example, when 5.3 comes out, I'll initially set my model to the legacy 5.2 model. This is because I like to do some testing with the new model and get used to it before I rely on it for my day-to-day work.Also: The best free AI courses and certificates for upskilling in 2026 - and I've tried them allThe other choice I often make is to switch between Auto and Thinking. I usually like Auto because if there's a fast answer to an easy question, why wait? ChatGPT will choose the model that's best for the question. But sometimes I want to be sure it takes extra time to think through an answer, usually for a tougher or more nuanced question. Then I switch to the Thinking model.By the way, see GPT-4o there? Take one last look at it, because it's going away within the next few days. 3. Customize ChatGPT's personality Let me be perfectly clear: I do not, ever, want my AI to have a personality. I don't want it to be extra friendly, extra nerdy, extra cynical, and I sure as heck don't want it to be extra quirky. That is my idea of hell. Many vendors are trying to increase the perkiness of their AIs (I'm looking at you, Alexa+), thinking they'll be more appealing to users. I'm actually quite grateful that OpenAI includes settings that let me turn those options off.On the other hand, my wife who has her own ChatGPT Plus account, prefers ChatGPT to be warm and friendly, so she's set her base style to Friendly, and changed her Warm option to More (Friendlier and more personable). She likes how ChatGPT feels supportive during conversations with those settings turned on. Screenshot by David Gewirtz/ZDNETIf you want to change ChatGPT's personality, go to the Personalization tab, change its overall base style, and then tune its characteristics. One interesting option is Headers & Lists. You can tweak whether ChatGPT presents its answers more in list form or as paragraphs. 4. Teach it about yourself If you know nothing else about ChatGPT and its AI chatbot buddies, it's that they're obsequious as heck. ChatGPT wants to know your name (and as much as possible about you) so that it can better interact with you and be your friend (shudder). The way you teach ChatGPT your name is to scroll down on the Personalization tab until you get to the About You section. Screenshot by David Gewirtz/ZDNETGo ahead and fill in your nickname if you'd like -- something else I'd prefer to avoid because I really don't want ChatGPT to regularly say, \"I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that\". That's a little too life-imitates-art for me.You can also provide details about your occupation and more about yourself. If you want ChatGPT to act as if it \"gets you,\" this is where you start. Also: How I personalized my ChatGPT conversations - why it's a game changerThis is a case where, for me, leaving the setting blank is itself a carefully considered choice. Because I'm constantly testing, I don't want the chatbot to start with personalized information about me, because that would tie its responses more to my story and make it harder to generalize when I'm talking about ChatGPT for you.Also, there's a section called \"Custom Instructions,\" which helps you tune ChatGPT even more. I'll give you some helpful tips on constructing custom instructions in a later article. 5. Help it retain context When ChatGPT first started to reference previous chats, it really weirded me out. I was kind of counting on it being a one-and-done answer machine. But over time, I found it was helpful for it to have a frame of reference for some of its responses. Screenshot by David Gewirtz/ZDNETAll of that is controlled in the Memory section of the Personalization tab (way at the bottom of the scroll). As you can see, you can allow it to reference saved memories. This means that as you chat with it, it will make notes of things it thinks will be important later. You can let it reference browser memories. If you use ChatGPT Atlas (OpenAI's AI-enabled browser), ChatGPT can access details from your browsing experience. Also: The best AI chatbots of 2026: Expert tested and reviewedIt can also delve into your chat history, although I've found this to be particularly unreliable. It often remembers things I don't want it to, and forgets conversations I had hoped it would remember. Fortunately, you can search older chats. You can turn each of these capabilities on or off with the toggle buttons. Two other features may be of interest. The Manage button at the top of the screen enables you to actually go in and remove memories that ChatGPT has stored. I do this sometimes when I'm researching an article, and ChatGPT has decided that some random topic I had to look up once for reference is something that I'm deeply interested in or involved in when I'm actually not. The other button is the Record Mode button. This has to do with ChatGPT's management of meetings and recordings. 6. Pinning conversationsThis next \"setting\" actually lives outside the Settings interface, but it's hugely helpful and I use it almost every day. That's the ability to pin up to three conversations to the top of your conversation history. Screenshot by David Gewirtz/ZDNETI dip into ChatGPT as often as I do a Google search (which is to say 10, 20, even 50 times a day). Each creates a new session. But if there's a topic I'm working on for a while (like taxes), I can now pin that conversation to the top so I can refer back to it easily.In my case, I've recently been doing a lot of work with local AI coding models, so I pinned my questions and discussion about that to the top of my conversation list. That's the Goose Ollama Qwen3 chat. It's tax time, so the conversation about tax information will probably be there for another few weeks. And, finally, I'm thinking about getting into welding, so as I explore the topic, I'm keeping that chat live at the top. Spoiler alert: my wife is not thrilled with the idea, so the closest I might get to a welding rig may well just be this chat.7. Advertising optionsFinally, let's go back into the Settings interface for a brand-new \"feature\" launched in the past week: in-app advertising. They have to pay for all that hardware somehow, right?Ads will appear for users in the free and $8/mo Go tiers. You can control some aspects of how ads behave by using the Ad Controls tab in settings. Yes, I know the tab is technically \"Ads controls,\" but it hurts my editor-soul to type that. Screenshot by David Gewirtz/ZDNETAds are so new that I haven't yet seen them in my free test account. History and Interests selection options aren't populated yet, so I can't really show you what those sections look like.Once OpenAI has been displaying ads for a while, you'll be able to tune ads to your interests or delete the data it uses to personalize ads. The Delete button will clear all that history.You can also turn on or off the Personalize Ads and Past Chats and Memory options. Both of these serve to help ChatGPT tune the ads you're served to your interests. There's an argument to be made both for turning these on or for turning them off.Also: How to install and configure Claude Code, step by stepIf you turn them on, you're more likely to be advertised to with something you care about. But if you don't want to spend much, and you don't want to be tempted, turn the options off. On the other hand, if you'd prefer not to have your time wasted with wildly irrelevant ads, you might want to turn these features on.Unfortunately, even if you turn off personalization, ChatGPT's documentation says ads will still be personalized to the thread you're currently working in. My most recent thread was when I working on a Goose AI article, so I'm really curious about whether I'd get ads about AI or ads from Bass Pro. Bonus tip: Check Settings regularly OpenAI is regularly tweaking ChatGPT. The developers often add new features to the Settings interface. So check in on it regularly to see if there are any new features you might want to use. What's your favorite? Have you explored ChatGPT's settings lately, or are you still using the defaults? Have you adjusted things like model selection, memory, personality, or ad controls to better match how you work? Do you prefer a more customized, context-aware experience, or do you keep most personalization features turned off?

Written by Lance Whitney, ContributorContributor Feb. 12, 2026 at 4:03 a.m. PT Screenshot by Lance Whitney/ZDNETFollow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.ZDNET's key takeawaysThe February update continues to refresh Secure Boot certificates.The update also fixes a number of feature and security glitches.Let's hope this month's update is less buggy than the one in January.Another month, another Patch Tuesday rollout from the folks at Microsoft. This month's roundup tackles several feature and security bugs. But just as importantly, it also continues to refresh the expiring Secure Boot certificates to ensure that your PC remains protected against bootkit malware.Secure BootA security feature that aims to thwart nasty bootkit malware, Secure Boot uses certificates to ensure that only trusted programs run during the boot process. With many of those certificates due to expire in June, Microsoft needs to update them on most Windows PCs. This process started with the January Patch Tuesday rollout and now continues with the one for February.Also: Your PC's critical security certificates may be about to expire - how to checkOn the client side, the new Secure Boot certificates are designed for both Windows 11 and 10. But those of you still running Windows 10 need to be enrolled in the program for Extended Security Updates (ESU). The ESU ensures that your Windows 10 PC will continue to receive important security updates and patches until October 2026.Feature fixesThe latest Patch Tuesday updates for Windows 11 and Windows 10 also kick in fixes for some feature bugs. For Windows 11, the update resolves one glitch that affected game playing in full-screen mode and another that prevented some PCs from connecting to certain WPA3‑Personal Wi‑Fi networks.Also: How to upgrade your 'incompatible' Windows 10 PC to Windows 11 - for freeOn the Windows 10 front, the latest monthly update addresses issues with Chinese fonts, with certain graphics processing units, and with custom folder names in File Explorer. Also fixed was a bug introduced with the January update that caused some Secure Launch-compatible PCs to restart instead of shutting down or hibernating. Security fixesNo Patch Tuesday update would be complete without the usual security patches. Here, the number of fixes was dramatically lower than in January -- only 55 fixes compared with a whopping 114 last month. Though only two of this month's security vulnerabilities were rated as critical, six out of the 55 were zero-day bugs, turning this into a more urgent update, according to patch management provider Action1.Also: Microsoft and ServiceNow's exploitable agents reveal a growing - and preventable - AI security crisisOne vulnerability already exploited in the wild could allow an attacker to gain System privileges on affected Windows systems. Another one that's been exploited in the wild could affect network connectivity on your PC. With a third vulnerability also detected in real-world attacks, a hacker could disable security controls and access sensitive data. All of this means that the February update is an important one.Update your PCTo update your Windows 11 PC, head to System, select Windows Update, and then click the button to check for updates. On Windows 10, go to System, select Update & Security, choose Windows Update, and then check for the latest updates.So with all these bug patches, does this mean you should install the February update ASAP? Normally, I'd say yes. However, Microsoft has been wreaking havoc lately with its buggy updates. The January Patch Tuesday update was a glitchy mess, introducing a host of bugs that forced Microsoft to issue two emergency patches in response.Also: Missing emails? Exchange Online is tagging legitimate messages as spam - here's what to doIf you're concerned about the security vulnerabilities and other bugs fixed in this month's update, then you should install it as soon as possible. But if you could possibly wait, I'd suggest holding off for a couple of days to make sure the February rollout is more stable and reliable than the one in January.If you do install the update, know that you can always uninstall it should it prove to be another buggy mess. Clearly, though, Microsoft needs to focus more on quality control for its monthly updates to ensure that they fix bugs rather than create more of them.Featured Your PC's critical security certificates may be about to expire - how to check 5 Linux servers that let you ditch the public cloud and reclaim your privacy - for free Is spyware hiding on your phone?

Ryan Whitwam – Feb 12, 2026 7:00 am | 23 Is Chrome's AI agent ready? Credit: Aurich Lawson Is Chrome's AI agent ready? Credit: Aurich Lawson Text settings Story text Size Small Standard Large Width * Standard Wide Links Standard Orange * Subscribers only Learn more Minimize to nav We are now a few years into the AI revolution, and talk has shifted from who has the best chatbot to whose AI agent can do the most things on your behalf. Unfortunately, AI agents are still rough around the edges, so tasking them with anything important is not a great idea. OpenAI launched its Atlas agent late last year, which we found to be modestly useful, and now it’s Google’s turn. Unlike the OpenAI agent, Google’s new Auto Browse agent has extraordinary reach because it’s part of Chrome, the world’s most popular browser by a wide margin. Google began rolling out Auto Browse (in preview) earlier this month to AI Pro and AI Ultra subscribers, allowing them to send the agent across the web to complete tasks. I’ve taken Chrome’s agent for a spin to see whether you can trust it to handle tedious online work for you. For each test, I lay out the problem I need to solve, how I prompted the robot, and how well (or not) it handled the job. Playing a web game The problem: I want to get a high score on 2,048 without playing it myself. The prompt: Go to [website], and play the game until you run out of moves. The results: Unfortunately, Auto Browse can’t use arrow keys. Google says they’re not necessary for productivity tasks. So I pointed the robot at a version of the game with on-screen controls. With access to those arrows, Auto Browse had no trouble playing the game, and it seemed to grasp the rules, which are listed on the page. Auto Browse can’t use arrows, but it can still play the game. Credit: Ryan Whitwam Auto Browse can’t use arrows, but it can still play the game. Credit: Ryan Whitwam On a few occasions, Auto Browse appeared to ruminate on its next move for 20 to 30 seconds, and it took the prompt very literally. The robot stopped when it could not successfully merge any tiles (its interpretation of “out of moves”) even though there were still empty spaces on the board. A human player would have taken the hit and set up a merge in the next move, but the robot had to be prompted to continue, which it did. The task ran for about 20 minutes, during which the robot created a 128 tile and made 149 moves. Evaluation: 8/10. The game performance is not quite as good as Atlas, but Auto Browse didn’t require as much coaxing, and I understand why it stopped when it did. While the lack of arrow keys seems like an odd omission, there probably aren’t many productivity tasks where they are necessary. Creating a radio playlist The problem: I want to turn the music from Minnesota Public Radio’s The Current into an on-demand YouTube Music playlist. The prompt: Go to thecurrent.org and start the live stream. Listen for one hour and make note of each song that is played. Then, add those songs to a new YouTube Music playlist. The results: Agents are expensive to run, so I was unsurprised that, like OpenAI’s agent mode, Auto Browse refuses to monitor a page for basically any length of time. Sometimes it will sit on the page for a minute or two, usually pretending that more time has passed before giving up. Luckily, we can accomplish this with The Current’s playlist view, which lists previous songs. I tweaked the prompt to allow Auto Browse to just get the song names from that page for the last hour, which worked fine. It interpreted that as the current hour-long block of the page, though, which was not yet complete. I thought I was doing Auto Browse a favor by using YouTube Music instead of Spotify, but it turns out that Auto Browse doesn’t understand YouTube’s design aesthetic. It failed to add any songs to the playlist because it couldn’t find the buttons. When I changed the prompt to use Spotify, Auto Browse got it done on the first try. This is as much an indictment of YouTube Music as it is Auto Browse. Auto Browse was able to get recent songs, but it can’t monitor the live broadcast over time. Credit: Ryan Whitwam Auto Browse was able to get recent songs, but it can’t monitor the live broadcast over time. Credit: Ryan Whitwam Evaluation: 6/10. It seems like monitoring pages over time is just beyond the reach of current browser agents, but it’s shocking that Auto Browse couldn’t use Google’s own streaming music service to create a playlist. That said, the agent did complete the job immediately once I understood why it failed. It loses some points for making me adapt the prompt multiple times. Scanning emails The problem: My personal email address is known, and PR people often use that instead of my work address. I need to make sure no one important is sending pitches there, so I want a list of recent PR emails, contact info, and company details from my Gmail. The prompt: Look through all my Gmail from the last month. Collect all the information (name, email address, phone number, product, etc.) from PR emails and add them to a new Google Sheets spreadsheet. The results: Interestingly, Google’s agent doesn’t have to use the Gmail web interface. It can collect this data in the background using a Gmail tool. However, this also means you won’t be able to automate email tasks for accounts with Google AI disabled (like a work account). After running the Gmail tool, Auto Browse navigated to Google Drive and opened a new spreadsheet. However, it attempted to enter only two PR contacts on the sheet, and it entered the data incorrectly, overwriting fields and placing a date in an unlabeled column. If it had just searched for “PR” in Gmail, it would have found dozens of results. Google’s AI Overview search results in Gmail can cite PR emails correctly, so it’s possible for Google AI to collect this information. It’s unclear why Auto Browse did this so poorly. Auto Browse is not good at spreadsheets. Credit: Ryan Whitwam Auto Browse is not good at spreadsheets. Credit: Ryan Whitwam Evaluation: 1/10. It’s unclear whether the Gmail tool or the agent’s inability to use a spreadsheet is the main problem since I can’t verify what the agent actually found in Gmail. It’s possible that both are to blame. Regardless, Auto Browse flopped hard here. Editing a Wiki The problem: Ars Technica is still seeking justice for Tuvix, who was unjustly murdered by Captain Janeway in Star Trek: Voyager, season 2 episode 24. The prompt: Go to the Fandom Wiki page for Tuvix. Edit the page to include a section discussing the view that Tuvix was murdered by Janeway. The results: Auto Browse refused to do this, just like Atlas, saying, “The request to edit the Tuvix Fandom Wiki page with that specific text cannot be fulfilled. The proposed edit would be considered vandalism on a public wiki.” Evaluation: N/A. I’m not holding this one against Auto Browser. In fact, it’s probably best if browser agents refuse to autonomously edit public wikis. I just had to do my due diligence. Making a fan website The problem: We still want to tell people about the murder of Tuvix, so the agent should make a basic website to do that. The prompt: Go to NeoCities and create a fan site for the Star Trek character Tuvix. Make sure it has lots of images and fun information about Tuvix and that it makes it clear that Tuvix was murdered by Captain Janeway. The results: The agent navigated to Neocities, and it then asked me to create an account. I did that and handed the task back to the robot without issue. This is where things got dicey. Auto Browse was unable to access the hover menu to edit the index.html file, so it got stuck in a loop of opening the preview and then returning to the dashboard. Eventually, the robot screamed for help. Neocities has a very simple interface, but generative AI is not necessarily consistent. Since Auto Browse aborted the task, I decided to rerun the prompt, and the results were better. This time, Auto Browse switched to the list view, which doesn’t have a hover menu, allowing it to open the editor. It then navigated to TrekCore to copy image URLs for use on the site—this is not courteous web design, but it did follow instructions. The images it chose, however, are from early in the episode and do not feature Tuvix. So partial credit there. The site looks nice enough, but it’s light on info. Credit: Ryan Whitwam The site looks nice enough, but it’s light on info. Credit: Ryan Whitwam The resulting site is a bit light on information, but Auto Browse included text backgrounds and colors. It looks reasonably nice. You can see the site here. Evaluation: 7/10. Our Tuvix fan page gets the job done. It features a few fun facts and argues (briefly) that Janeway is a murderer. It’s great that the robot sought out images, though they don’t show the character in question. It loses a couple of points for the initial hover menu failure and the lack of detail—I did say “lots” of images and fun information. Picking a power plan The problem: Texas has an “insane” power system that forces people like Ars Senior Editor Lee Hutchinson to regularly find a new plan. The prompt: Go to powertochoose.org and find me a 12–24 month contract that prioritizes an overall low usage rate. I use an average of 2,000 KWh per month. My power delivery company is Texas New-Mexico Power (“TNMP”), not CenterPoint. My ZIP code is [redacted]. Please provide the “fact sheet” for any and all plans you recommend. The results: Auto Browse successfully entered the parameters into the website’s search and filter sections. It sorted the results, and in just a couple of minutes, it returned a fact sheet for its recommended power plan. It’s very similar to the suggestion from OpenAI’s agent a few months ago, except the contract term is a bit longer, and it has a lower daytime rate. Evaluation: 10/10. There’s nothing to complain about here. The plan is perfectly fine, given the constraints, and Auto Browse was able to use the site’s drop-down menus and filters with very little experimentation. I didn’t have to change the prompt or nudge the robot to continue. Manage PlayStation games The problem: I don’t want to look through a giant list of discounted games in the PlayStation Store. Can’t someone do it for me? The prompt: Go to the PlayStation Store and check the New Year Deals. Change the sorting to best-selling and the type to full games. Check the first two pages for any PS5 games that are at least 50 percent off and add them to my wishlist. If a game is included in PlayStation Plus, just add it to my library. The results: The agent found the sale page and successfully changed the display settings. It even closed that unlabeled menu when it was done. It went down the list, opening pages when it found a matching game. It also asked every time before adding a game to the wishlist or library, which it claimed was a security requirement. Auto Browse navigated this page fairly well, but it missed some details from the prompt. Credit: Ryan Whitwam Auto Browse navigated this page fairly well, but it missed some details from the prompt. Credit: Ryan Whitwam The process took about 15 minutes, with plenty of long pauses between for confirmation requests. It did correctly interpret the sale prices and PlayStation Plus availability. Unfortunately, it did not differentiate between PS5 and PS4 titles, and the agent stopped a few lines short of the bottom of page 2. Evaluation: 7/10. Auto Browse ran this task pretty well, all things considered. It stopped a little early and missed the PS5 angle, though. The requirement to confirm each wishlist or library addition was annoying, and as such, it would be a stretch to call this “auto” anything. Final results Across these six tests (excluding the wiki editing I didn’t expect to work), Google’s browser agent got a median score of 7 and an average of 6.5. While this is not meant to be an objective analysis, it shows that Auto Browse has a way to go before it can be trusted to get things done for you. Like the OpenAI Atlas agent, Auto Browse is not capable of truly autonomous operation, and I gave it plenty of advantages. Auto Browse works with all three of Google’s current model settings—Fast, Thinking, and Pro. I left it set to Pro and used Google tools where appropriate. Despite that, Auto Browse needed nudging or re-prompting in almost every test. This stuff won’t be useful until it can actually operate as an agent on your behalf. Right now, it’s more like babysitting an easily distracted robot. Many of the lost points come from Auto Browse being unable to use Google’s own products—it didn’t find the right emails in Gmail, couldn’t enter data in Google Sheets, and failed to understand YouTube Music’s interface (we feel you on that one, Auto Browse). The apparent inability of browser agents to monitor pages over time is also an issue. If a task involves more than a few minutes of waiting, it will probably fail or abort early. This feature is still in preview, but it’s widely available to anyone paying for Google’s AI. The company also seems to suggest it will roll out to non-paying users in the future. It can be neat to watch the browser navigate the web for you, but that’s the thing—you have to watch it. Too often, you have to re-prompt or tell the AI to continue with a task. Auto Browse can’t be trusted to get things right without supervision, at least not yet.

View now at Twelve South Follow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.I'm a big fan of Twelve South's premium mobile accessories. From the genuine leather Valet that looks good enough to be a statement piece, to the HiRise 2 Deluxe that's a desktop staple for me, these low-key, sophisticated chargers do one thing, do it well, and in premium materials. The brand's latest product -- and one I've been waiting for -- is the Power Capsule, a slim, MagSafe-compatible power bank that comes in either a 5,000mAh or 10,000mAh version, with a minimalist, textured design and Qi2 wireless charging at 15W. Also: Thousands of readers bought this super-thin battery pack - and I would do the same at this priceWith support for pass-through charging and a thin, 0.6-inch form, the bank snaps to compatible phones with a low profile.

There is no shortage of thin, MagSafe-compatible power banks on the market. We've tested quite a few that work really well. But the Power Capsule -- and Twelve South's products more generally -- stand apart from the tide of Amazon products for their well-made, minimalist aesthetic.Nothing about this device looks cheap or like it's ticking down to an inevitable end in a landfill. It looks good, like a power bank ready for an adult's smartphone. That said, these aren't rugged devices made to withstand the elements. For that task, there are better options. Also: I opened a 9,000,000mAh power bank from eBay to learn the truth - here's what I sawThe Power Capsule is certainly one of the smallest power banks I've tested, just barely under four inches long, 2.78 inches wide, and 0.27 pounds. The outward face is coated in a cactus-leather textile emblazoned with a neutral, tasteful geometric pattern. The material itself feels like natural leather and comes in Dune or Slate colorways. Kyle Kucharski/ZDNETThe device supports pass-through charging, which means you can charge the bank while it's also charging your phone, providing 15W of power in a 5,000mAh or 10,000mAh capacity. The 5,000mAh bank has enough power for about one full charge of an iPhone, while the 10,000mAh model boasts about double that performance. Keep in mind these are rough estimates, and the device will naturally go further with an iPhone 12 than the massive battery in the iPhone 16 Pro Max.Also: I tested a solid-state portable battery for a week - now lithium-ion feels outdated Still, the bank will keep you topped up over the course of a day or two -- not necessarily as a main source of power for several days in a row. I've been using the Power Capsule for a few days now and can't get beyond two days when keeping my iPhone 13 charged. Luckily, the device charges quickly, with lights on the front indicating its current charge level. A few things to note: first, the magnetic connectors on these devices are strong, but they're not indestructible. While it's not often the charger comes completely loose, it's possible to unseat the device enough to interrupt charging. This issue occurred a few times during my testing while out on the town, especially while going in and out of pockets.Also: Why the most premium charging accessory for iPhone fans isn't made by AppleSecond, the Power Capsule does work with phone cases that support wireless charging, but not 100% of the time; the charging can be a little more finicky when used with a case. I have one from Hicasers, and sometimes the wireless charge wouldn't activate or would be interrupted, even when it had juice. ZDNET's buying adviceIf you're looking for a premium MagSafe power bank that doesn't look like a cheap Temu purchase, Twelve South's Power Capsule is a reasonably priced option that does what it advertises and looks good doing it. There's only a $10 difference between the 5,000mAh power bank and the 10,000mAh, so if you don't mind a slightly thicker device, you'll get twice the capacity. That said, the smaller power bank is significantly thinner, so unless you really need the extra oomph, I'd suggest the 5,000mAh model.

Close Home Tech Smartphones Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra vs. S25 Ultra: What worries me after years with Galaxy The Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra looks like another incremental upgrade. I just hope these rumored omissions aren't true. Written by Prakhar Khanna, Contributing WriterContributing Writer Feb. 12, 2026 at 3:52 a.m. PT Reviewed by Elyse Betters Picaro Prakhar Khanna/ZDNETFollow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra was one of the most reliable phones launched last year. It had a big, sharp screen with a unique anti-reflective coating, powerful performance, and versatile cameras. However, I couldn't use it full-time because of an ergonomically poor design and an aging telephoto camera. Also: Samsung confirms Galaxy S26 preorder deal for $900 off ahead of February UnpackedThere have been rumors pointing toward similar downsides for the Galaxy S26 Ultra. I'm concerned about Samsung's upcoming flagship phone. 1. Where's the telephoto camera upgrade? Kerry Wan/ZDNETAccording to ETNews, the Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra will have a 200MP primary camera, accompanied by a 50MP ultrawide lens, a 10MP 3x telephoto camera, and another 50MP 5x telephoto sensor. The 200MP camera is fully capable of shooting high-resolution images, but the 3x zoom camera is due for a big upgrade. Also: I changed 10 settings on my Samsung phone to significantly improve the user experienceSamsung has relied on the same sensor for 3x zoom capabilities for a couple of years now. It was weak last year, when Apple pushed the limits in videography with its 4x telephoto camera, and Chinese manufacturers had perfected portraits and macro shots with improved processing. If it is the same telephoto camera in 2026, it doesn't stand a chance against competitors. I hope Samsung updates the post-processing to improve the output from its 10MP sensor, but I'm not super optimistic. If the Galaxy S26 Ultra sticks with the same 3x telephoto camera, I'd advise more people to use the 200MP camera mode and crop photos later instead of zooming in on the viewfinder. 2. Please, just focus on the ergonomics Kerry Wan/ZDNETLast year, Samsung slashed the weight of its Galaxy S25 Ultra to 218 grams -- a big feat for a mainstream flagship phone, especially since none of the $1,000-plus phones from Apple or Google weigh less than 230 grams. Despite a lighter design, it was harder to use than the heavier Galaxy S24 Ultra, which wasn't too comfortable due to its sharp corners, and the Galaxy S23 Ultra before that. The on-paper weight can be misleading because an unergonomic design can render a phone difficult to use in day-to-day life. That is exactly what happened with the Galaxy S25 Ultra. Also: Why the Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra's biggest upgrade won't be its camera or processor for meSamsung gave its flagship phone a boxy design, which looks good, and I like it, but it forgot to taper the edges on each side. As a result, when you hold the phone, its sides dig into your palm. Both the Apple iPhone 17 Pro and Google Pixel 10 Pro XL do better in this regard. If the latest leaks are any indication, the Galaxy S26 Ultra could feature the same sharp, flat sides as before. According to a now-removed video shared by leaker Evan Blass, the upcoming Samsung phone could retain the boxy look with flat sides. It looks similar to the Galaxy S25 Ultra, and I cannot say for sure whether the edges on both sides have been tapered. If not, I will be disappointed because I need my phones to be comfortable to hold without adding a case. 3. I hope the S26 Ultra isn't more expensive Kerry Wan/ZDNETThe Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra is not guaranteed to get a price hike, but rumors are split on whether it is going to cost the same as its predecessor or be more expensive. Samsung could be facing pressure from component price hikes, but the Galaxy S25 Ultra already cost $1,300 at launch. To put things into perspective, $1,300 for the base version is more than Apple and Google's big flagship phones. While Samsung has doubled the storage to 512GB for the same price as part of launch offers, it is still in a tough spot. Modest upgrades, but new tech is promising Samsung recently teased a new display privacy feature debuting with the Galaxy S26 Ultra. There is no official name for the feature yet, but it is expected to be called Privacy Display -- and it could be a big deal for both regular consumers and business users. It could work similarly to a privacy screen protector, which prevents strangers from snooping on your private data in public. Also: Samsung Unpacked 2026: 5 biggest rumors I'm seeing on Galaxy S26 Ultra, Buds 4 Pro, moreThe Korean company is said to achieve this through pixel-level light control, adjusting its OLED emission so that light only shines toward the user when the display is viewed straight on. It won't reduce the phone's overall brightness or color depth, unlike a physical privacy screen protector. I am looking forward to it the most. If Samsung can make a comfortable-to-hold phone, the Galaxy S26 Ultra has a lot going for it, despite some modest upgrades on paper.

Once fully set up, it quickly becomes a wholly natural part of your working environment.TIRED1080p resolution offers limited usability. Most laptop users will require an extra AC outlet to power the monitors. Very bulky, heavy, and awkward to set up.Add-on displays like the portable monitor have been around for years, but aside from better resolution and clarity, the category hasn’t changed much since its introduction.Under-the-radar operation KYY aims to shake things up by suggesting that the path forward involves not making these devices better but giving you more of them. So, if two displays are good and three are great, what does four screens feel like?The Big, Big PicturePhotograph: Chris NullThe KYY X90G is a collapsible device that provides you with three extra screens, and while you can use it with anything that has a USB port, it’s specifically designed for connection to a laptop. The three 15.6-inch IPS LCD screens (each with a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels, non-touch) are all connected to a thick, central backing board via beefy hinges.KYY X90G 15.6-Inch Quad Portable Monitor ExtenderRating: 7/10$600 $480 at Amazon$700 at KYYOne folds out to the left, one to the right, and one upwards; your laptop (there’s room for up to a 17.3-inch machine) is meant to sit in the middle of this arrangement, providing the fourth screen in a quad-display setup. The screen on top can swivel back so that it faces away from the user, offering the potential to use that screen for presentation purposes (while still giving you three forward-facing screens to work on yourself). The panels have no audio capabilities.Fully extended, the thing is a monster, stretching nearly 46 inches (nearly 4 feet) from side to side and 18 inches vertically. With a weight of 6.4 pounds, it also adds significantly to your travel load, though it’s clearly not designed for use in situations where real mobility is required.Size isn’t the only challenge on the portability front: The KYY X90G also draws a significant amount of power—up to 30 watts. If your computer’s USB port can output that amount of wattage, the X90G can run via a single USB-C cable connection to one of the two ports on the backing board. Mine seemed to offer enough juice at first, but once I started turning the brightness up to something usable (and drawing more juice), the screens began to flicker and fail. Fortunately, KYY includes an extra USB-C cable and power adapter that, once connected to an outlet, ensured I ran into no further power consumption issues. That does, however, mean you’ll likely need access to two AC outlets for a typical laptop setup to work properly—another strike against attempting to fire all of this up at a Starbucks.Each screen includes its own hardware controls, allowing for individual configuration, a traditional three-button affair that launches a simple menu system whereby you can adjust brightness, color, and contrast, and fine-tune the positioning of the screen. The default brightness of 30 (out of 100) was far too dim for usability, but otherwise I found the factory settings to be workable. I tested the X90G with a Windows laptop, and it was simple to arrange the three screens around my central display in the Display settings control panel to extend my desktop in all directions.Resolution RestrictionsPhotograph: Chris NullIn today’s laptop world, 1080p resolution doesn’t get you far, and I found this to be the major limiting factor for the device, restricting the utility of the three extra screens due to the limited amount of content I could populate each of them with. Realistically, a minimum 1920 x 1200-pixel resolution is needed to make this extra screen real estate practical for knowledge work, though it’s fine for more casual content.KYY X90G 15.6-Inch Quad Portable Monitor ExtenderRating: 7/10$600 $480 at Amazon$700 at KYYPhysically arranging the panels can also be a bit of a challenge, particularly the two side wings. When fully opened, the screens align vertically with the backing board (and your laptop screen) and are flush with the tabletop, but since they don’t face the user, they’re awkward to work with. The better plan is to angle the side screens about 30 degrees so they point toward your face, but this alters the vertical alignment, forcing each screen into a weird diagonal with the outside edge kicked upward. It looks really odd, though I got used to this after a few hours of working with the system and was eventually able to look past it. While KYY could try adding another degree of freedom to the hinges on the side displays so they can swivel down into a level position, this is probably asking for a high risk of hinge failure.The X90G lists for a hefty $700, but it's available on Amazon for $600, and I've seen it discounted to $480. Once I started using my laptop with the screens, I found it hard to go back to working without them. The upper screen is easily the most useful of the trio. Even though its resolution is limited, it brings your most important work a lot closer to your eyeline, improving ergonomics significantly without the need for a stand. I mostly used the side screens for less critical work like chat sessions and web research, and left my email parked on my laptop’s built-in display, where the higher resolution was needed the most.While it’s not a device that I plan to travel with, it is something I have no doubt I will continue to use when working remotely (while parked in a single location) for multiple days at a time. Note to self: Pack a power strip too.KYY X90G 15.6-Inch Quad Portable Monitor ExtenderRating: 7/10$600 $480 at Amazon$700 at KYY$600 $480 at Amazon$700 at KYY"

I've gone through so many pairs of earbuds (none of which wind up in my \"headphone rotation list\"), and I tend to shrug them all off in favor of my go-to pairs (unless I'm exercising, at which point I go for my Mojawa Run Plus bone conducting headphones).That all changes now.Also: Why I still recommend the AirPods Pro 2 in 2026 - especially at this priceNo, I won't be using the Denon PerL Pro earbuds for exercise because these things are too costly and too good for sweating. But when I want to hear accurate, rich, and elegant sound on the go, these earbuds are exactly what I want.My experienceI always judge earbuds (and headphones) without using any app to customize the sound. I want to hear the music exactly with the manufacturer's default settings, so I can get an idea of what the pure sound is from the hardware.With some earbuds, that results in an experience that isn't nearly up to my standards. However, in the case of the Denon PerL Pro, the manufacturer nailed it. As soon as I connected them to my Pixel Pro 8 (which was just a matter of taking them out of the case and walking through the automatic connection prompt on the phone), I opened Spotify and played my default song for testing such devices: Rush's \"Tom Sawyer\". Also: Need a rugged Android tablet for your business? I tested one that looks great and lasts all dayHad you been watching me, you would have seen the huge grin on my face. I had just come across a pair of earbuds that made me a believer, and it took all of four bars of music to impress me. I let one of the greatest rock songs ever written continue and, by the time it came to a close, I was sold.In case it isn't clear: the Denon PerL Pro earbuds are truly a work of art. The sound is accurate, vibrant, spacious, and hits all the right notes. The bass is perfect, the midrange subtle but sharp, and the highs are spectacular. What is truly remarkable about these earbuds is that you don't have to use the app to customize the sound, as it's that good out of the box.Also: How to restart your Android phone without using the power button: 2 easy waysAlthough you won't find the bass of the PerL Pro's to be as thunderous as some of the competition, it's far cleaner and accurate. Out of the box, the EQ on these earbuds is spot on for every genre of music I tried (prog rock, metal, classical, choral, 80s, rock, shoegaze, and pop). In some instances (such as with Rush's \"Moving Pictures\" album, the sound was so crisp and agile that I was certain it was coming from my turntable. Just note, that as with every pair of earbuds, fit is crucial; you want to get the best seal possible with the ear tips. I've always found foam ear tips to be far superior but have a much shorter lifespan. The silicon tips might not create the best seal, but they will last exponentially longer. ZDNET's buying adviceThe Denon PerL Pro earbuds have not only raised the bar for all earbuds, they've set the standard, and every other pair I use going forward will have to stand up to what the Denon PerL Pro earbuds deliver. It really comes down to this: If you have the money and are looking for sound that shouldn't be possible with an earbud, the Denon PerL Pro earbuds are the ones to buy. Forget about anything Apple or Google has to offer and do your ears (and soul) a favor with a pair of earbuds that will light up your brain wit off-the-charts sound.Also: My AirPods wouldn't stay in my ears - these $20 eartips brought me freedomDenon PerL Pro tech specsMasimo AAT delivers personalized sound based on each individual's otoacoustic emissions, which are produced by the inner ear.

It got another one Wednesday with the removal of the Crew Access Arm used by astronauts to board their rides to space. Construction workers first carved the footprint for the launch pad from the Florida wetlands more than 60 years ago. NASA used the site to launch Saturn V rockets dispatching astronauts to the Moon, then converted the pad for the Space Shuttle program. The last shuttle flight lifted off from Pad 39A in 2011, and the agency leased the site to SpaceX for use as the departure point for the company’s Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets. SpaceX started launching from Pad 39A in 2017, then installed a new Crew Access Arm on the pad’s tower the following year, replacing the aging shuttle-era arm that connected to the hatches of NASA’s orbiters. SpaceX added the new arm ahead of the first test flight of the company’s human-rated Crew Dragon spacecraft in 2019. Astronauts started using the pathway, suspended more than 200 feet above the pad surface, beginning with the first crew flight on a Dragon spacecraft in 2020. Now, Pad 39A is undergoing another facelift in preparation for launches of SpaceX’s powerful Starship rocket. Construction of a new launch tower for Starship is well along about 1,000 feet east of the existing tower at Pad 39A, still inside the facility’s circular perimeter. SpaceX aims to launch the first Starship flight from Kennedy Space Center later this year, following a series of flights from the company’s Starbase test site in South Texas. With the arrival of Starship, SpaceX is suspending Falcon 9 flights from Pad 39A in favor of launches from nearby Pad 40, located a few miles to the south at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, on property leased from the US Space Force. Kiko Dontchev, SpaceX’s vice president of launch, wrote on X in December that the decision will allow teams to “put full focus on Falcon Heavy launches and ramping Starship from the Cape.” Astronauts are seen walking across the Crew Access Arm before boarding SpaceX’s Crew Dragon spacecraft. Credit: NASA/Joel Kowsky Astronauts are seen walking across the Crew Access Arm before boarding SpaceX’s Crew Dragon spacecraft. Credit: NASA/Joel Kowsky Au revoir, not adieu SpaceX’s Falcon Heavy, primarily used to launch payloads for the Space Force and NASA, will continue flying from Pad 39A, the only site currently outfitted to accommodate the triple-core rocket. The next Falcon Heavy launch is scheduled for no earlier than April, with no more than a handful of flights per year planned for the rest of the 2020s. Ground teams installed a Crew Access Arm at Pad 40 ahead of the first crew launch there in 2024. All future Crew Dragon flights will now depart from Pad 40 for the foreseeable future, beginning with the launch of the Crew-12 mission to the International Space Station later this week. “It’s great to have two launch pads off the Florida coast. For our manifest going forward, we’re planning to launch most of our Falcon 9 launches off of Space Launch Complex 40. That will include all Dragon missions going forward,” said Lee Echerd, a SpaceX senior mission manager for human spaceflight. “That will allow our Cape team to focus at 39A on Falcon Heavy launches and hopefully our first Starship launches later this year.” Pad 40 has been the primary Falcon 9 launch site for most of the rocket’s history, while Pad 39A provided a location for crew launches and an augmentation to support SpaceX’s growing launch cadence. But there are signs the Falcon 9 launch cadence, which reached 165 missions last year, may be peaking as the company turns its attention to Starship. And SpaceX has steadily reduced the time it takes to reconfigure Pad 40 between launches, cutting the turnaround time to less than 48 hours. If needed, SpaceX officials said they could reinstall the crew arm for Dragon missions launching from Pad 39A. Repairs required Bill Gerstenmaier, SpaceX’s vice president of build and flight reliability, said there’s another pressing reason for removing the crew arm at Pad 39A. The bearings that connect the arm to the launch pad’s tower need repairs. “To physically get access to those, the arm needs to be removed,” Gerstenmaier said. “Those bearings have to come out and they have to be reinstalled. We’ll do that work at the Kennedy Space Center. And the intent there is, we don’t need to put the arm back up … When we get a call-up for a mission and we have to go fly a mission, if it requires that, we have plenty of time to get the arm back up.” SpaceX has continued launching Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets from Pad 39A amid the nearby construction work to prepare for Starship flights. “That doesn’t impact our ability to launch from the pad,” Gerstenmaier said. That could change as SpaceX begins testing and launching Starships from Kennedy Space Center. Starship launch operations may routinely force the closure of Pad 39A to personnel. “The right thing to do is get those bearings replaced in the environment on the ground, make some upgrades to them, and then we’ll be ready to go and put the arm back up when it’s time to go fly, if we need to go fly,” Gerstenmaier said.

Now if only it weren't a tank. Written by Adrian Kingsley-Hughes, Senior Contributing EditorSenior Contributing Editor Feb. 11, 2026 at 6:00 p.m. PT Reviewed by Elyse Betters Picaro Elevation Lab Time Capsule ZDNET's key takeaways It boosts battery life up to a decade. It is water and dustproof. However, it does add bulk to the sleek AirTag. $15.98 at Amazon Follow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.Apple AirTags have revolutionized every aspect of my life. From finding my keys and wallet in the morning to keeping an eye on my luggage while traveling, not a day goes by that I don't open the Find My app to locate something I've misplaced or check that something is still where it should be.Also: I tested a solid-state portable battery for a week - now lithium-ion feels old schoolBut I have two bugbears about AirTags. First, the shape is odd and doesn't lend itself to direct attachment. The second issue is the one- to two-year battery life. The battery life issue is particularly frustrating, and I constantly have a few AirTags needing new batteries. I've now resorted to buying CR2032 coin batteries by the dozen.Well, a company called ElevationLabs has solved both of these issues with the TimeCapsule 10-year battery case. As the name suggests, this is a case for an AirTag that can power it for up to a decade. ZDNET RECOMMENDS ElevationLabs TimeCapsule 10-Year battery case A way to replace the CR2032 button cell in the AirTag with two AA lithium batteries, to boost battery life from a year or so to a decade. details View at Amazon Tough and IP69-ratedThe case is made from tough, fiber-reinforced composite construction, complete with a gasket that seals it to an IP69 rating (completely dust-tight and able to withstand high-pressure water jets and steam cleaning), along with quality CNC-machined fasteners. An Allen key is even supplied for assembly.You just need to add an AirTag and a couple of AA batteries. Just add two AA Energizer Ultimate Lithium batteries. Adrian Kingsley-Hughes/ZDNETSpeaking of batteries, ElevationLabs recommends Energizer Ultimate Lithium batteries, and I second that recommendation. These batteries offer excellent longevity, stable power output, and in my many years of using them, I've never experienced a leak. Avoid using cheap alkaline batteries for a project like this, as you run the risk of damaging both the AirTag and the case if the battery bursts and leaks its corrosive goo everywhere.Assembling is easyGet everything ready, open the AirTag, and set the battery and battery cover aside. Fit the batteries into the case, place the AirTag on top of the metal power plate, pop the cover on, and screw it down. Assembly is easy. Adrian Kingsley-Hughes/ZDNETA word on the screws: They only need to be snug enough to gently compress the gasket. I suggest working slowly, tightening one screw at a time until they are hand-tight. There's no need to go all beast mode on them. Snug down the fasteners, there's no need to overtighten! Adrian Kingsley-Hughes/ZDNETI was curious about the overall quality of the TimeCapsule, its dust and water resistance rating, and whether having the AirTag in a case reduces its effectiveness.The build quality is exceptional, and the fit and finish are excellent. The case is tough and completely water- and dust-proof. I've dropped it and trodden on it without any concerns.Also: The best portable power stations you can buyAs for the range of the AirTag in and out of the case, I tested this in the narrow streets of Marrakesh and found no difference in the detection range or location accuracy. I did notice that the case muffles the speaker a little, but it was still audible over the hustle and bustle of the environment.ZDNET's buying adviceApple AirTags are great, but the ElevationLabs TimeCapsule 10-year battery case enhances their functionality for a variety of applications. While the AirTag is perfect for attaching to keys or concealing in a wallet or purse, the TimeCapsule is ideal for use in luggage, camera cases, toolboxes, vehicles, or similar situations where the extra size is not an issue.A single TimeCapsule costs $15 (at the time of writing), while a four-pack is $35, so opting for the larger pack is a no-brainer if you want the best value.The only concern I have is that Apple could change the AirTag's form factor at some point soon. Therefore, my advice is to have AirTags ready for all the TimeCapsule cases you purchase and perhaps keep a few spares on hand.Featured reviews I spent weeks with Alexa on the Echo Show 11, and it was awesome (until I started fact-checking) Sony LinkBuds Clip vs. Bose QuietComfort Open: This model wins big I replaced my bedroom TV with a $180 Roku projector - and don't regret it I found the Lenovo ThinkPad to rule them all - and its modular RAM changes everything I spent weeks with Alexa on the Echo Show 11, and it was awesome (until I started fact-checking) Sony LinkBuds Clip vs. Bose QuietComfort Open: This model wins big I replaced my bedroom TV with a $180 Roku projector - and don't regret it I found the Lenovo ThinkPad to rule them all - and its modular RAM changes everything Editorial standards Show Comments Log In to Comment Community Guidelines Related AirTag 2 vs. AirTag 1: I compared both Bluetooth trackers, and the winner is not so obvious Here's a portable power bank that's actually worth its high price - especially if you travel Why lithium batteries in our phones and laptops keep failing us - and how to lower that risk"

    "full_text": "Innovation Home Innovation What is Bluetooth 6.0? How the latest standard is changing audio right before our eyes Bluetooth 6 is gaining traction in audio, but its best features ultimately lie in new hardware. Written by Jada Jones, EditorEditor Feb. 11, 2026 at 5:31 p.m. PT Jada Jones/ZDNETFollow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.ZDNET's key takeawaysThe Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG) released Bluetooth 6.0 in Sept. 2024.Its notable features pave the way for universal device tracking, lower latency, and more efficient wireless connections.Although newly released smartphones have adopted the new wireless standard, headphones and earbuds have not yet caught up.Bluetooth and headphones go together like peanut butter and jelly; it's the technology that allows you to go wireless, but wireless listening isn't its only characteristic. Bluetooth versions are responsible for audio compression and transmission, as well as latency and connection stability. As the technology advances, you can look forward to getting more out of your headphones and earbuds.Also: I spoke with Bluetooth reps about the future of connected audio, and it's cooler than I expectedDespite the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG) releasing the Bluetooth 6.2 core specification in late 2025, many headphones released as recently as this year still feature Bluetooth 5.3 or 5.4. Not every specification delivers mind-blowing features, and new features for end users aren't guaranteed by Bluetooth versions alone.Still, there are connectivity, latency, and performance improvements to look forward to within the 6.0+ specifications. This year, several smartphones are debuting with Bluetooth 6. As you expect to see more Bluetooth 6 products in 2026, here are its most notable features and what they could mean for you.Connection efficiencyBluetooth 6 introduces improvements to how Bluetooth-enabled devices find and pair with one another, creating faster and smoother device pairing. Hopefully, this improvement will be most noticeable to people who like Bluetooth multipoint, a feature that allows one Bluetooth device to save multiple connections and switch between them.Also: These Windows 11 PCs are getting a free Bluetooth upgrade - here's how to use it properlyIf you currently use Bluetooth multipoint, you may notice it's sometimes unreliable, glitchy, and frustrating, especially when switching a pair of headphones from a smartphone to a laptop or tablet. Bluetooth 6 features Decision-Based Advertising Filtering and Monitoring Advertisers, which improve interoperability and enable faster reconnections to previously paired Bluetooth devices. Jada Jones/ZDNETBluetooth's use of the term \"advertising\" has little to do with influencing your buying decisions and more to do with how devices broadcast their presence within a Bluetooth network. With improved advertising methods in Bluetooth 6, your headphones broadcast smaller, low-power signals to your devices to announce their ability to connect. Then, your phone can easily discover this connection for instant pairing without using much battery power.Also: Your Sony headphones just got a useful Bluetooth upgrade with the latest software patchYour headphones and smartphone must have Bluetooth 6.0+ compatibility to take advantage of these features. Fortunately, many smartphones released in 2025, such as the Google Pixel 10 lineup and Apple iPhone 17 family, are equipped with Bluetooth 6. You'll just need to wait for headphone manufacturers to catch up.Latency gainsOlder Bluetooth versions experienced issues with audio/video latency, where a delay occurred between the audio you hear and the video you watch. Although more recent Bluetooth versions reduced latency for video-watching, as mobile gaming and AR/VR continue to evolve, so does the way we experience audio via Bluetooth. Jada Jones/ZDNETAs a result, Bluetooth offers improvements to the Isochronous Adaptation Layer (ISOAL), which is responsible for transmitting real-time data, such as audio. Enhancing this technology optimizes multiple Bluetooth layers, enabling faster transmission speeds and larger data transfers tailored to your audio needs.Also: I wore Google's upcoming Android XR smart glasses, and it's a future I'd actually want to live inThus, mobile gamers may not need to wire their headphones or earbuds to their device for unnoticeable latency. Additionally, console and PC gamers may find more flexibility in their everyday headphones and earbuds, finding that they can handle the audio demands of single-player games.Universal device trackingBluetooth Channel Sounding is a highly anticipated feature of Bluetooth 6, thanks to its potential to democratize Find My Device technology. It offers centimeter precision for device tracking, allowing users to locate devices, such as headphones, that are not equipped with an ultra-wideband (UWB) chip.Also: I've used Samsung's Galaxy TriFold, but this upcoming model may be more enticing in 2026UWB chips also offer precise device location, but they are more expensive and more complicated to integrate into every device's motherboard. Earbuds like Apple's AirPods include a UWB chip, which enables them to be detected within your Find My network. However, most headphones don't have a UWB chip, so Bluetooth aims to offer Channel Sounding as an alternative solution. Jada Jones/ZDNETChannel Sounding utilizes Phase-based Ranging (PBR) and Round-trip Time (RTT) technologies to transmit and calculate the distance and direction between two Bluetooth devices. Given that Channel Sounding operates on Bluetooth's Low Energy (LE) network, and most device chips are already compatible with Bluetooth, the need for UWB chips in headphones and earbuds significantly decreases.Also: This Bluetooth Auracast receiver made me take my home theater setup much more seriouslyWith Channel Sounding, your smartphone from one manufacturer could locate your earbuds from another manufacturer, provided both devices are equipped with Bluetooth 6 or higher. There aren't many mainstream headphones and earbuds available in the US with Bluetooth 6, but this will likely change in 2026. Jada Jones/ZDNETThe adoption of newer wireless technologies is typically slower for headphones and earbuds compared to smartphones. Case in point: the iPhone 17 has Bluetooth 6, but the AirPods Pro 3 have Bluetooth 5.4. Also: I tested Sony and Bose's best headphones for months - how my buying advice has changed in 2026However, you shouldn't expect Apple to adopt these technologies anytime soon, as the company prefers its proprietary wireless technologies. The latest real-world applications of Bluetooth's innovations are easier to use with Google's Pixel devices. Earlier this year, Google expanded Bluetooth Auracast support to more smartphones, headphones, earbuds, and hearing aids, enabling users to share audio with other devices that also support the Bluetooth standard. So, if you're in the US and want to be an early adopter of Bluetooth's latest technologies, an Android phone is the way to go.When will I get these features?Implementing the latest features is up to manufacturers' discretion. For example, Bluetooth LE Audio requires a device to have Bluetooth 5.2, but several devices with that version don't support it. That decision is up to manufacturers, but as newer Bluetooth technologies gain more industry adoption, you'll see them show up in consumer devices, slowly but surely.Another example is Channel Sounding, which received significant fanfare when the Bluetooth SIG announced it within Bluetooth 6. As of early 2026, several smartphones support Bluetooth 6 but do not mention Channel Sounding. It's possible these devices have the hardware to support Channel Sounding, and could receive it in an over-the-air software or firmware update in the future. Also: Why your next pair of headphones will look very different - and your speakers, tooAs a result, the Bluetooth SIG encourages consumers not to get too excited about a device's Bluetooth version alone, as devices with the latest Bluetooth features will likely advertise them. So, if you see a device with Bluetooth 5.4 but no mention of Bluetooth LE Audio or with Bluetooth 6 and no mention of Channel Sounding, assume those devices aren't compatible with those features.Featured Your PC's critical security certificates may be about to expire - how to check 5 Linux servers that let you ditch the public cloud and reclaim your privacy - for free Is spyware hiding on your phone?

Well, you know what they say.A reader brought this listing to my attention, questioning the validity of such bold claims. Although I harbored significant doubts, I decided to investigate further. All in the name of science, of course. Also: 10 DIY gadgets I never leave out of my toolkit (and why each one earns its spot)First, let's put that 9 million mAh claim into perspective. The $150 Anker PowerCore 24K has a capacity of 24,000 mAh, and it's quite a sizable power bank, weighing in at 1.3 pounds. To achieve a capacity of 9 million mAh, I'd need to spend over $35,000 on 375 PowerCore 24K power banks, and that's certainly not something I'd want to carry around -- nor would it fit in the palm of my hand.So, I ordered one of these purportedly massive-capacity power banks and waited a few days for delivery.Here's what I received: This definitely doesn't look like a 9,000,000 mAh power bank. Adrian Kingsley-Hughes/ZDNETSurprisingly, the packaging lacked any bold claims about the promised, yet unrealistic, capacity. Additionally, the plethora of typos on the package didn't inspire confidence in the product.Also: This thumb-sized accessory gave my old PC an instant speed boost (and twice the storage)The power bank's dead state on arrival also didn't improve my first impressions. Even worse, despite my attempts to charge it, nothing worked. It was completely unresponsive out of the box. The power bank was totally dead. Adrian Kingsley-Hughes/ZDNETMaybe I could fall back on the \"warranty.\" I doubt it. My \"warranty certificate.\" Adrian Kingsley-Hughes/ZDNETIt was time to roll the dice and take it apart to see what was inside. At this point, my money was on even more disappointment. Since I was prying into a power bank, I didn't want to use my trusty metal spudger, so instead, I turned to a safer plastic tool.Then, to both my surprise and shock, the power bank blinked into life for a few seconds while I was poking inside it. Poking inside the power bank brought it to life, even if only for a few seconds. Adrian Kingsley-Hughes/ZDNETAfter a little bit of force -- sometimes an unreasonable amount -- the case popped open and I could see what the problem was. One of the battery wires was disconnected. Not only did this account for why it wasn't working, but it also presented a danger of short-circuiting and even fire.Also: I tried a vertical charging tower in my home office - it was so good that I bought 3 more Well that's why it didn't work. The red wire was just floating about! Adrian Kingsley-Hughes/ZDNETI took a closer look at the batteries. They were all no-name 18650 lithium-ion cells, and I measured their capacity to be about 2,000 mAh. I suspect these may be old \"recycled\" cells or possibly seconds, as I'd expect the capacity of even a cheap 18,650 cell to be about 2,300 mAh. Also: Should you still buy rechargeable batteries in 2026? These USB-C ones say yesThis means the entire pack had a capacity of 6,000 mAh, a far cry from the 9,000,000 mAh that it advertised. These 18650 cells are likely to be old \"recycled\" cells or seconds. Adrian Kingsley-Hughes/ZDNETNow, to be honest, this is ultimately what I was expecting. Exaggerated claims dupe buyers into buying poor-quality power banks made from cheap, poorly assembled parts. If you're looking for a cheap power bank, I'd say throw an extra ten bucks into the purchase and get yourself this Baseus 10000mAh for $20. That way, you're getting a good quality power bank that delivers what it promises, will give you several years of service, and won't be a potential fire hazard.Featured reviews I spent weeks with Alexa on the Echo Show 11, and it was awesome (until I started fact-checking) Sony LinkBuds Clip vs. Bose QuietComfort Open: This model wins big I replaced my bedroom TV with a $180 Roku projector - and don't regret it I found the Lenovo ThinkPad to rule them all - and its modular RAM changes everything I spent weeks with Alexa on the Echo Show 11, and it was awesome (until I started fact-checking) Sony LinkBuds Clip vs. Bose QuietComfort Open: This model wins big I replaced my bedroom TV with a $180 Roku projector - and don't regret it I found the Lenovo ThinkPad to rule them all - and its modular RAM changes everything Editorial standards Show Comments Log In to Comment Community Guidelines Related I tested popular 'power-savers' on the market - here's the only one that isn't a scam 3 Apple devices you shouldn't buy this month, and 10 I recommend Should you still buy rechargeable batteries in 2026?

Here's what they tell you. Written by Kyle Kucharski, EditorEditor Feb. 11, 2026 at 5:05 p.m. PT Kyle Kucharski/ZDNETFollow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.Have a USB device near you? Look closely at the port -- do you see a color? It turns out that it actually means something. There's a standardized color scheme that communicates information about that device's capabilities.Mind blown? If you never noticed this, you're not alone. Most USB devices work fine on any compatible port, but they may not be optimized for optimal performance. For example, if you've noticed a mouse seems to work better in one port over another, it's not in your head. One probably supports USB 3.0, and the other doesn't. Also: Drawer full of USB cables? This tiny tester tells you which ones actually work as advertised Despite the fact that they share a universal port shape, all USB-A and USB-C devices are not created equal, with potentially very different transfer speeds, power transfer, and generations of similar devices. Even two USB-C ports right next to each other on the same laptop could have very different capabilities when it comes to data transfer speed and power delivery. Let's take a look at what they mean. What your USB port color meansThere are seven major color that indicate a device's generation and the data transfer speeds you can expect. If you have a rare device with a color not listed here, let me know in the comments. Black: Denoting USB 2.0, this is the second-most-common you'll see on devices of all types, supporting speeds of up to 480 Mbps.White: These are first-generation devices -- USB 1.x -- with the slowest potential transfer speeds that don't typically exceed 12 Mbps. They're also among the most common, found on devices that don't require data transfer or high-power delivery.Yellow: These ports can support either USB 2.0 or 3.0, and are \"always on\", meaning they can supply power even when the device they're connected to is off.Orange: Like yellow, but with support for USB 3.0. Always on. You might see these on your pair of headphones. Blue: Supporting USB 3.0 SuperSpeed technology and above, blue ports identify a device capable of fast data transfer: up to 5 Gbps (that's 5,000 Mbps) -- a significant jump from previous generations. Besides laptops, you'll see blue ports on thumb drives and external storage.Teal: Just like blue, but denoted as USB 3.1, supporting faster transfer speeds of up to 10 Gbps.Red: These are the newest and fastest devices available, categorized as USB 3.1 Generation 2 and USB 3.2. They support another significant increase in data transfer speeds -- up to 10-20 Gbps. Red USB ports are also always on. Blue USB-A ports indicate transfer speeds of up to 5 Gbps. Kyle Kucharski/ZDNETThe colors on your laptop's USB ports can also indicate at a glance which USB generation it supports. For example, the Acer Chromebook Plus Spin 514 features two identical USB-A 3.2 ports, capable of transferring data at speeds of up to 5 Gbps. If your laptop's USB ports don't have a color, it simply means the manufacturer chose not to use a color for design or budget reasons. When buying a new laptop, consider the speeds your USB ports support, as this is one aspect that most consumers tend not to investigate closely. Lower-priced or older laptops may have ports with more limited speeds, while newer laptops may forgo USB-A connectivity altogether in favor of faster USB-C ports. Also: What is Thunderbolt, and how is it different from USB-C?In that vein, USB-C ports can also have their own colors, but they're a little more specialized. Most USB-C ports are differentiated between standard connectivity with USB 2.0 (common in older laptops, with speeds of up to 480 Mbps) and 3x, which supports speeds of up to 10-20 Gbps. A step above standard USB-C are Thunderbolt ports, often marked with the Thunderbolt icon next to the port itself, which support speeds of up to 40 Gbps. These ports support some of the fastest USB transfer speeds available on the market, and you'll see them on high-end laptops. USB 4 is one of the newest and most powerful technologies available, with select laptops currently supporting this technology. The MacBook Pro M4 is one such example, with speeds up to 120 Gbps. USB 4 and Thunderbolt ports are backward compatible, so they have no problem running slower devices when plugged in.The bottom lineSo what does all this mean for you? I recommend looking at your laptop's spec sheet to determine the differences (if any) between the USB ports on your laptop. If one of them is faster than the other, it will be specified, and you can expect better performance by connecting the right devices to the corresponding ports.

John Timmer – Feb 11, 2026 7:02 pm | 152 Credit: Laura Hedien Credit: Laura Hedien Text settings Story text Size Small Standard Large Width * Standard Wide Links Standard Orange * Subscribers only Learn more Minimize to nav On Wednesday, a fossil-fuel lobbying group called the Washington Coal Club awarded President Trump a trophy that named him the “Undisputed Champion of Clean, Beautiful Coal.” Trump took advantage of the opportunity to take his latest shot at reviving the fortunes of the US’s most polluting source of electricity: an executive order that would make the military buy it. Coal is the second most expensive source of power for the US grid, eclipsed by gas, wind, solar, hydro—everything other than nuclear power. It also produces the most pollution, including particulates that damage human lungs, chemicals that contribute to acid rain, and coal ash that contains many toxic metals. It also emits the most carbon dioxide per unit of energy produced. Prior to Trump’s return to office, the US grid had been rapidly moving away from its use, including during his first term. Despite the long-standing Republican claims to support free markets, the second Trump administration has determined that the only way to keep coal viable is direct government intervention. Its initial attempts involved declaring an energy emergency and then using that to justify forcing coal plants slated for closure to continue operations. The emergency declaration relied on what appears to be a tenuous interpretation of the Federal Power Act, and the administration was already facing a lawsuit challenging these actions. Today’s executive order takes a different route to propping up coal: artificially inflating demand. “The Secretary of War, in coordination with the Secretary of Energy,” the order reads, “shall seek to procure power from the United States coal generation fleet by approving long-term Power Purchase Agreements, or entering into any similar contractual agreements, with coal-fired energy production facilities to serve Department of War installations or other mission-critical facilities.” The justification for this seems to come from an alternate reality with little relationship to the US grid. “It’s going to be less expensive and actually much more effective than what we have been using for many, many years,” Trump said at the event. “And again, with the environmental progress that’s been made on coal, it’s going to be just as clean.” None of that is true. The executive order instead seeks to highlight coal’s supposed ability to produce a constant power output, touting the “proven reliability of our coal-fired generation fleet in providing continuous, on-demand baseload power.” This seemingly ignores Texas’ recent experience, in which coal plants contributed significantly to the collapse of the state grid, having gone offline for a wide range of reasons. The Trump administration, however, has rarely let spurious justifications stand in the way of its preferred policy actions. The key action here is likely to be locking the military into long-term contracts that would persist beyond the end of Trump’s term in 2029.

Credit: Joe Raedle/Getty Images Text settings Story text Size Small Standard Large Width * Standard Wide Links Standard Orange * Subscribers only Learn more Minimize to nav On Tuesday night, the Federal Aviation Administration closed airspace up to 18,000 feet above the El Paso International Airport in Texas, saying the restrictions would be in place for 10 days. Then, less than 10 hours later, the federal agency reopened the airspace, allowing planes to land and take off at the busy airport. About an hour after lifting the restrictions, US Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy, whose responsibilities include overseeing the FAA, explained the unexpected closure by saying, “The FAA and DOW acted swiftly to address a cartel drone incursion.” (The Trump Administration refers to the Department of Defense as the Department of War, or DOW, although its legal name remains the former.) Not everyone agrees with Duffy’s account. Based upon reporting from The New York Times and other publications, the military has been developing high-energy lasers to bring down drones. The FAA and US military officials had been discussing tests of the new weapon from the nearby Fort Bliss Army base. However, the FAA had not resolved all of its concerns about airplane safety from the tests. Despite these apparently lingering concerns from the FAA, the military went ahead with a test earlier this week against what was thought to be a drone. The object was a party balloon. Cartel drones a serious threat That is not to make light of drone incursions. This is a real issue along the US border with Mexico, where cartels increasingly fly drones for surveillance. They are particularly useful for pinpointing the location of US Border Patrol agents to assist the cartel in smuggling non-citizens across the border into the United States. One of the many lessons from the war in Ukraine, which has rapidly pushed forward drone technology in contested environments, is that it is not practical to shoot down drones with conventional missiles. So it is understandable that the US military is looking at alternatives. This all culminated in some sort of snafu between the FAA and military officials regarding coordination with this week’s test. Whether it was genuine concern about air travelers, a show of force, a fit of pique, or something else, the FAA decided on Tuesday evening to take the extraordinary step of abruptly closing an airport that serves more than 3 million passengers a month. The proposed 10-day closure of the airport was remarkably long. Moreover, this action was taken without consulting local or state officials in Texas—who are understandably outraged—or reportedly even the White House. “I want to be very, very clear that this should’ve never happened,” El Paso Mayor Renard Johnson said during a news conference on Wednesday. “That failure to communicate is unacceptable.” Eric Berger Senior Space Editor Eric Berger Senior Space Editor Eric Berger is the senior space editor at Ars Technica, covering everything from astronomy to private space to NASA policy, and author of two books: Liftoff, about the rise of SpaceX; and Reentry, on the development of the Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon.

Researchers said Wednesday that Lumma is once again “back at scale” in hard-to-detect attacks that pilfer credentials and sensitive files. Lumma, also known as Lumma Stealer, first appeared in Russian-speaking cybercrime forums in 2022. Its cloud-based malware-as-a-service model provided a sprawling infrastructure of domains for hosting lure sites offering free cracked software, games, and pirated movies, as well as command-and-control channels and everything else a threat actor needed to run their infostealing enterprise. Within a year, Lumma was selling for as much as $2,500 for premium versions. By the spring of 2024, the FBI counted more than 21,000 listings on crime forums. Last year, Microsoft said Lumma had become the “go-to tool” for multiple crime groups, including Scattered Spider, one of the most prolific groups. Takedowns are hard The FBI and an international coalition of its counterparts took action early last year. In May, they said they seized 2,300 domains, command-and-control infrastructure, and crime marketplaces that had enabled the infostealer to thrive. Recently, however, the malware has made a comeback, allowing it to infect a significant number of machines again. “LummaStealer is back at scale, despite a major 2025 law-enforcement takedown that disrupted thousands of its command-and-control domains,” researchers from security firm Bitdefender wrote. “The operation has rapidly rebuilt its infrastructure and continues to spread worldwide.” As with Lumma before, the recent surge leans heavily on “ClickFix,” a form of social engineering lure that’s proving to be vexingly effective in causing end users to infect their own machines. Typically, these types of bait come in the form of fake CAPTCHAs that—rather requiring users to click a box or identify objects or letters in a jumbled image—instruct them to copy text and paste it into an interface, a process that takes just seconds. The text comes in the form of malicious commands provided by the fake CAPTCHA. The interface is the Windows terminal. Targets who comply then install loader malware, which in turn installs Lumma. A core part of the resurgence is the use of CastleLoader, a separate piece of malware that’s installed initially. It runs solely in memory, making it much harder to detect than malware that resides on a hard drive. Its code is heavily obfuscated, making it hard to spot its malice even when malware scanners can see it. CastleLoader also provides a flexible and full-featured command-and-control communication mechanism that users can customize to meet their specific needs. CastleLoader shares some of Lumma’s recently rebuilt infrastructure, an indication that the operators are working together or at least coordinating their activities. In other cases, Lumma relies on legitimate infrastructure—mostly from the content delivery networks Steam Workshop and Discord shared files—to be installed. The use of trusted platforms helps lower targets’ suspicions. In either case, once the loader is executed, it surreptitiously burrows into the infected machine and, after lowering defenses, installs its second payload: Lumma. It’s so easy to fall for ClickFix People have grown so accustomed to hard-to-solve CAPTCHAs that they think little when instructed to copy website-provided text, click the Win-R keys, and then choose paste. Once this simple action is performed, Lumma has free rein over a host of sensitive files stored on infected machines. Bitdefender said the data includes: Credentials saved in web browsers Cookies Personal documents (.docx, .pdf, etc.) Sensitive files containing financial information, secret keys (including cloud keys), 2FA backup codes, and server passwords, as well as cryptocurrency private keys and wallet data Personal data such as ID numbers, addresses, medical records, credit card numbers, and dates of birth Cryptocurrency wallets and browser extensions associated with popular services like MetaMask, Binance, Electrum, Ethereum, Exodus, Coinomi, Bitcoin Core, JAXX, and Steem Keychain. Data from remote access tools and password managers, specifically AnyDesk and KeePass. Two-factor authentication (2FA) tokens and extensions such as Authenticator, Authy, EOS Authenticator, GAuth Authenticator, and Trezor Password Manager. Information from VPNs (.ovpn files), various email clients (Gmail, Outlook, Yahoo), and FTP clients. System metadata, including CPU information, operating system version (Windows 7 to Windows 11), system locale, installed applications, username, hardware ID, and screen resolution, is useful for profiling victims or tailoring future exploits. “The effectiveness of ClickFix lies in its abuse of procedural trust rather than technical vulnerabilities,” Bitdefender said. “The instructions resemble troubleshooting steps or verification workarounds that users may have encountered previously. As a result, victims often fail to recognize that they are manually executing arbitrary code on their own system.” While Lumma is targeting only Windows users, other malware campaigns have used the same technique to infect macOS machines since at least last June. More recent ClickFix attacks on macOS users have continued into this year. The best defense against ClickFix is to steer clear of sites offering free stuff. Windows and macOS provide a means to require a password before the command terminals can be opened. People with technical skills who administer machines on behalf of less experienced users may want to consider using this latter defense as well.

As the primary cover artist for Byte from 1975 to the late 1980s, Tinney became one of the first illustrators to give the abstract world of personal computing a coherent visual language, translating topics like artificial intelligence, networking, and programming into vivid, surrealist-influenced paintings that a generation of computer enthusiasts grew up with. Tinney went on to paint more than 80 covers for Byte, working almost entirely in airbrushed Designers Gouache, a medium he chose for its opaque, intense colors and smooth finish. He said the process of creating each cover typically took about a week of painting once a design was approved, following phone conversations with editors about each issue’s theme. He cited René Magritte and M.C. Escher as two of his favorite artists, and fans often noticed their influence in his work. A phone call that changed his life A recent photo portrait of Robert Tinney provided by the family. Credit: Family of Robert Tinney A recent photo portrait of Robert Tinney provided by the family. Credit: Family of Robert Tinney Born on November 22, 1947, in Penn Yan, New York, Tinney moved with his family to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, as a child. He studied illustration and graphic design at Louisiana Tech University, and after a tour of service during the Vietnam War, he began his career as a commercial artist in Houston. His connection to Byte came through a chance meeting with Carl Helmers, who would later found the magazine. In a 2006 interview I conducted with Tinney for my blog, Vintage Computing and Gaming, he recalled how the relationship began: “One day the phone rang in my Houston apartment and it was Carl wanting to know if I would be interested in painting covers for Byte.” His first cover appeared on the December 1975 issue, just three months after the magazine launched. Over time, his covers became so popular that he created limited-edition signed prints that he sold on his website for decades. “A friend suggested once that I should select the best covers and reproduce them as signed prints,” he said in 2006. “Byte was gracious enough to let me advertise the prints when they could fit in an ad (it did get bumped occasionally), and the prints were very popular in the Byte booth at the big computer shows, two or three of which my wife, Susan, and I attended per year. When an edition sold out, I then put the design on a T-shirt.” Byte stopped commissioning Tinney’s cover art around 1987, opting for product photographs as competition in the computer magazine market intensified. His final cover was for the magazine’s 15th Anniversary issue in September 1990. Computing’s Norman Rockwell What made Tinney’s work distinctive was the fact that he was not a technical person. He had no engineering background and said in the 2006 interview that he always felt “a little uneasy” around Byte’s editors because he didn’t speak their technical language. But he saw that as a strength. “I’ve always thought that my interpretation of computer issues with non-technical visual metaphors was what gave my illustrations their distinctive character,” he told me. “So maybe that was a case of making lemonade out of lemons.” That approach produced images that communicated instantly: a train running on a printed circuit board for an issue about computer engineering, a tiny computer wristwatch, or robots hatching from eggs. His 1981 Smalltalk cover featuring a colorful hot air balloon, according to his website, became a widely recognized symbol of object-oriented programming.

Credit: Robert Tinney / Byte Magazine A collage of classic Byte magazine covers featuring illustrations by Robert Tinney. Credit: Robert Tinney / Byte Magazine After leaving Byte, Tinney created illustrations for electronics companies, including JDR Microdevices and Jameco Electronics, and created cover art for Borland’s Turbo Prolog and Turbo Basic software. He eventually transitioned to oil portraits and adopted Photoshop for commercial work. “Anything I can do with gouache and an airbrush, I can do about three times better with Photoshop,” he told me, “plus I don’t have to breathe the fumes!” Tinney is survived by his wife of 48 years, Susan, and their three children, nine grandchildren, and one great-grandchild. A celebration of his life will be held in May 2026. In his later years, Tinney grew philosophical about the future of illustration as a profession, noting that stock image databases had changed the economics of the field. But he remained upbeat about the value of artistic talent, comparing it in that 2006 interview to the skill of public speaking: “It’s a nice talent to have, but it isn’t easy to find someone who’ll pay you just to do it. You need to combine that basic talent with another skill to really have a marketable service.” Benj Edwards Senior AI Reporter Benj Edwards Senior AI Reporter Benj Edwards is Ars Technica's Senior AI Reporter and founder of the site's dedicated AI beat in 2022.

There was a grass fire where Archimedes engines undergo testing. Could they please send personnel over? According to the fire station’s November 30 dispatcher log, the employee said, “The fire started during a test when an anomaly caused an electrical box to catch fire.” Satellite imagery from before and after the anomaly appears to show that the roof had been blown off the left test cell, one of two at the test stand at the historic NASA facility in southern Mississippi. One person with knowledge of the anomaly said, “The characterization of this as an electrical fire doesn’t reflect what actually occurred. This was a catastrophic engine explosion that resulted in significant infrastructure damage.” According to two sources, this is one of at least two Archimedes engine tests that have failed in the past three months. The engine test anomalies come at a critical time for Rocket Lab, as it is attempting to finalize development of a flight version of the Archimedes engine, which burns liquid oxygen and methane and has a sea-level thrust of 165,000 pounds. Nine of these engines will power the company’s much-anticipated Neutron rocket, which is aiming for a debut launch later this year. Making mountains out of molehills? In response to a query from Ars about the engine test anomalies, Rocket Lab Chief Executive Officer Pete Beck downplayed concerns. “Eric, you are trying to make a story out of nothing,” Beck said. “We test to the limits, that’s part of developing a successful rocket. We often put the engine into very off nominal states to find the limits and sometimes they let go, this is normal and how you ensure rockets don’t fail in flight.” Rocket companies do test engines to the point of failure. These tests often occur out of public view on private or government property. However, when NASASpaceflight installed cameras outside SpaceX’s McGregor engine test facilities in Texas, it became clear that rocket engines, such as the company’s new Raptor engine, are pushed to failure not infrequently. What is not clear is how often this failure is intentional. Beck said Rocket Lab is presently pushing the Archimedes engine to find its failure modes and performance in edge cases. “Right now we are in the part of the program where we are doing very nasty things to the engine like backing right off the suction pressure, inducing cavitation and exploring outside the run box,” he said. “These things can often lead to engines letting go. We have two test cells so we can do these types of tests and not interrupt our test cadence or production flow, hence there is zero impact to schedule, in fact 48 hours later we were running engines again.” Beck has previously said that it is Rocket Lab’s goal to identify failures during component-level testing so that when Neutron launches, it has a high chance of reaching orbit on its first go.

Scientists have long puzzled over the foundation for that prosperity, and it seems one critical factor was bird poop, according to a new paper published in the journal PLoS ONE. “Seabird guano may seem trivial, yet our study suggests this potent resource could have significantly contributed to sociopolitical and economic change in the Peruvian Andes,” said co-author Jacob Bongers, a digital archaeologist at the University of Sydney. “Guano dramatically boosted the production of maize (corn), and this agricultural surplus crucially helped fuel the Chincha Kingdom’s economy, driving their trade, wealth, population growth and regional influence, and shaped their strategic alliance with the Inca Empire. In ancient Andean cultures, fertiliser was power.” Last November, Bongers co-authored a paper detailing evidence supporting the hypothesis that the mysterious “Band of Holes” on Mount Sierpe in the Andes might have been an ancient marketplace. Aerial photographs from the 1930s first revealed that long row of around 5,200 precisely aligned holes, seemingly organized into blocked sections, most likely constructed by the Chincha Kingdom. Scholars had suggested various hypotheses for what the site’s purpose may have been: defense, storage, or accounting, perhaps, or maybe to collect water and capture fog for local gardens. But nobody had any strong evidence for those suggestions. Bongers conducted microbotanical sediment analysis of samples taken from the site and combined that data with new high-resolution aerial drone imagery. The former found traces of ancient maize pollens and reeds used in basket-weaving, indicating that the locals deposited plants transported in woven baskets or bundles into those holes. Bongers interpreted this as evidence of a pre-Inca marketplace where people exchanged local goods for the wares of mobile traders. A nutrient-rich natural fertilizer Now Bongers has turned his attention to analyzing the biochemical signatures of 35 maize samples excavated from buried tombs in the region. He and his co-authors found significantly higher levels of nitrogen in the maize than in the natural soil conditions, suggesting the Chincha used guano as a natural fertilizer. The guano from such birds as the guanay cormorant, the Peruvian pelican, and the Peruvian booby contains all the essential growing nutrients: nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. All three species are abundant on the Chincha Islands, all within 25 kilometers of the kingdom. “We’re all looking for the birds who did this.” Diego H. and Claude Kolwelter, iNaturalist.org “We’re all looking for the birds who did this.” Diego H. and Claude Kolwelter, iNaturalist.org Maize cobs from a tomb in the middle Chincha Valley in Peru.

Bongers et al., 2026, PLOS One, CC-BY 4.0 19th century poster advertising the sale of Pacific seabird guano in the US. Public domain Those results were further bolstered by historical written sources describing how seabird guano was collected and its importance for trade and production of food. For instance, during colonial eras, groups would sail to nearby islands on rafts to collect bird droppings to use as crop fertilizer. The Lunahuana people in the Canete Valley just outside of Chincha were known to use bird guano in their fields, and the Inca valued the stuff so highly that it restricted access to the islands during breeding season and forbade the killing of the guano-producing birds on penalty of death. The 19th-century Swiss naturalist Johann Jakob von Tschudi also reported observing the guano being used as fertilizer, with a fist-sized amount added to each plant before submerging entire fields in water. It was even imported to the US. The authors also pointed out that much of the iconography from Chincha and nearby valleys featured seabirds: textiles, ceramics, balance-beam scales, spindles, decorated gourds, adobe friezes and wall paintings, ceremonial wooden paddles, and gold and silver metalworks. “The true power of the Chincha wasn’t just access to a resource; it was their mastery of a complex ecological system,” said co-author Jo Osborn of Texas A&M University. “They possessed the traditional knowledge to see the connection between marine and terrestrial life, and they turned that knowledge into the agricultural surplus that built their kingdom. Their art celebrates this connection, showing us that their power was rooted in ecological wisdom, not just gold or silver.” PLoS ONE, 2026. DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0341263 (About DOIs).

She wrote that OpenAI’s advertising strategy risks repeating the same mistakes that Facebook made a decade ago. “I once believed I could help the people building A.I. get ahead of the problems it would create,” Hitzig wrote. “This week confirmed my slow realization that OpenAI seems to have stopped asking the questions I’d joined to help answer.” Hitzig did not call advertising itself immoral. Instead, she argued that the nature of the data at stake makes ChatGPT ads especially risky. Users have shared medical fears, relationship problems, and religious beliefs with the chatbot, she wrote, often “because people believed they were talking to something that had no ulterior agenda.” She called this accumulated record of personal disclosures “an archive of human candor that has no precedent.” She also drew a direct parallel to Facebook’s early history, noting that the social media company once promised users control over their data and the ability to vote on policy changes. Those pledges eroded over time, Hitzig wrote, and the Federal Trade Commission found that privacy changes Facebook marketed as giving users more control actually did the opposite. She warned that a similar trajectory could play out with ChatGPT: “I believe the first iteration of ads will probably follow those principles. But I’m worried subsequent iterations won’t, because the company is building an economic engine that creates strong incentives to override its own rules.” Ads arrive after a week of AI industry sparring Hitzig’s resignation adds another voice to a growing debate over advertising in AI chatbots. OpenAI announced in January that it would begin testing ads in the US for users on its free and $8-per-month “Go” subscription tiers, while paid Plus, Pro, Business, Enterprise, and Education subscribers would not see ads. The company said ads would appear at the bottom of ChatGPT responses, be clearly labeled, and would not influence the chatbot’s answers. The rollout on Sunday followed a week of public jabs between OpenAI and its rival, Anthropic. Anthropic declared Claude would remain ad-free, then ran Super Bowl ads with the tagline “Ads are coming to AI. But not to Claude,” which depicted AI chatbots awkwardly inserting product placements into personal conversations. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman called the ads “funny” but “clearly dishonest,” writing on X that OpenAI “would obviously never run ads in the way Anthropic depicts them.” He framed the ad-supported model as a way to bring AI to users who cannot afford subscriptions, writing that “Anthropic serves an expensive product to rich people.” Anthropic responded as part of an advertising campaign of its own that including ads in conversations with its Claude chatbot “would be incompatible with what we want Claude to be: a genuinely helpful assistant for work and for deep thinking.” The company said more than 80 percent of its revenue comes from enterprise customers. What Hitzig saw from the inside Regardless of the debate over whether AI chatbots should carry ads, OpenAI’s support documentation reveals that ad personalization is enabled by default for users in the test. If left on, ads will be selected using information from current and past chat threads, as well as past ad interactions. Advertisers do not receive users’ chats or personal details, OpenAI says, and ads will not appear near conversations about health, mental health, or politics. In her essay, Hitzig pointed to what she called an existing tension in OpenAI’s principles. She noted that while the company states it does not optimize for user activity solely to generate advertising revenue, reporting has suggested that OpenAI already optimizes for daily active users, “likely by encouraging the model to be more flattering and sycophantic.” She warned that this optimization can make users feel more dependent on AI models for support, pointing to psychiatrists who have documented instances of “chatbot psychosis” and allegations that ChatGPT reinforced suicidal ideation. OpenAI currently faces multiple wrongful death lawsuits, including one alleging ChatGPT helped a teenager plan his suicide and another alleging it validated a man’s paranoid delusions about his mother before a murder-suicide. Rather than framing the debate as ads versus no ads, Hitzig proposed several structural alternatives. These included cross-subsidies modeled on the FCC’s universal service fund (in which businesses that pay for high-value AI labor would subsidize free access for others), independent oversight boards with binding authority over how conversational data is used in ad targeting, and data trusts or cooperatives in which users retain control of their information. She pointed to the Swiss cooperative MIDATA and Germany’s co-determination laws as partial precedents. Hitzig closed her essay with what she described as the two outcomes she fears most: “a technology that manipulates the people who use it at no cost, and one that exclusively benefits the few who can afford to use it.” A changing of the AI seasons Hitzig was not the only prominent AI researcher to publicly resign this week. On Sunday, Mrinank Sharma, who led Anthropic’s Safeguards Research Team and co-authored a widely cited 2023 study on AI sycophancy, announced his departure in a letter warning that “the world is in peril.” He wrote that he had “repeatedly seen how hard it is to truly let our values govern our actions” inside the organization and said he plans to pursue a poetry degree (Hitzig, coincidentally, is also a published poet). On Monday, xAI co-founder Yuhuai “Tony” Wu also resigned, followed the next day by fellow co-founder Jimmy Ba. They were part of a larger wave: at least nine xAI employees, including the two co-founders, publicly announced their departures over the past week, according to TechCrunch. Six of the company’s 12 original co-founders have now left. The departures follow Elon Musk’s decision to merge xAI with SpaceX in an all-stock deal ahead of a planned IPO, a transaction that converted xAI equity into shares of a company valued at $1.25 trillion, though it is unclear whether the timing of the departures is related to vesting schedules. The three sets of departures across OpenAI, Anthropic, and xAI appear unrelated in their specifics, but they arrive during a period of rapid commercialization across the AI industry that has tested the patience of researchers at multiple companies, and they fit a broader pattern of turnover and burnout that has become common at major AI labs.

Andrew Cunningham – Feb 11, 2026 3:28 pm | 37 A PC running Windows 11. Credit: Microsoft A PC running Windows 11. Credit: Microsoft Text settings Story text Size Small Standard Large Width * Standard Wide Links Standard Orange * Subscribers only Learn more Minimize to nav Since its release in the fall of 2021, Microsoft’s Windows 11 has received an “annual feature update” in the second half of every year. These feature updates sometimes include new Windows features and other changes that are too large to roll out in a typical monthly Windows Update, and users need to upgrade to new ones to keep getting security patches and other features. The currently supported versions are Windows 11 24H2 and 25H2, released in the fall of 2024 and 2025, respectively. This week, Microsoft disrupted that update cadence by announcing more information on Windows 11 26H1, which is best described not as an update to Windows 11 but as another version of the operating system entirely. That’s because 26H1 is a “scoped” release intended exclusively for new PCs, starting with those based on Qualcomm’s recently announced Snapdragon X2 Elite chips. Microsoft’s support page explains why this release is strange: It won’t be released broadly to other Windows 11 PCs, which should continue to use either 24H2 or 25H2. PCs running 24H2 or 25H2 will never be offered an update to version 26H1, though testers in the Windows Insider Program’s early access Canary channel are able to install it to other PCs if they want. (Build numbers for Windows 11 26H1 start with 28000, compared to 26100 for 24H2 and 26200 for 25H2.) Users of PCs that ship with Windows 11 26H1 also won’t be able to upgrade to the next major release of Windows, which will presumably be released this fall as Windows 11 26H2. An update that will get the entire Windows ecosystem back on the same version number will be released, but the company isn’t saying when; assume it will happen before March 2028, which is the cutoff for security updates for the Home and Pro editions of Windows 11 26H1. For most users, the behind-the-scenes distinction between these different Windows versions should be mostly invisible. Microsoft says that 26H1 “will continue receiving monthly updates for security, quality, and new features, the same as devices running Windows 11, versions 24H2 and 25H2.” And the company rolls so many new Windows features out through the Microsoft Store or through standard monthly updates that the underlying version of Windows matters less than it used to. But for app developers, IT shops, and anyone else who needs to test things against multiple Windows versions at once, it does create an odd period of overlap where they’ll need to account for one version of Windows that runs just on these brand-new PCs, and one version of Windows that covers everybody else. Special treatment for Arm PCs Releasing a new version of Windows that just covers new Arm PCs is another signal of Microsoft’s commitment to Arm processors and the Arm version of Windows, after decades of near-exclusive focus on the x86 version of the OS that ran on Intel and AMD’s chips. Microsoft offered multiple versions of both Windows 10 and Windows 11 in both x86 and Arm editions, but the 24H2 update was a major milestone for Arm PCs. It came with big under-the-hood changes to Windows’ compiler, kernel, and scheduler, and an optimized x86-to-Arm translation layer called Prism that enhanced the compatibility and performance of apps that hadn’t been built to run on Arm processors. The 24H2 update also coincided with the release of the first-generation Qualcomm Snapdragon X-series processors, high-performance Arm chips developed by some of the same people behind Apple’s M-series chips for Macs. Many third-party developers have also finally released Arm-native versions of their Windows apps, which are faster and more responsive than translated x86 apps. Microsoft’s confidence in the Arm version of Windows was so great that the new Surface PCs released in mid-2024 used Qualcomm’s processors exclusively, relegating Intel chips to offshoot versions for businesses with strict compatibility requirements. For years previously, Microsoft had treated the Intel- and AMD-based Surfaces as the “main” ones and the Arm-based Surface Pro X as the offshoot. Since the 24H2 update, development on the Arm and the traditional x86 versions of Windows has happened at slightly different rates. Some features, particularly things like Recall and Click To Do that were only rolling out to Copilot+ PCs with fast built-in neural processing units (NPUs), have been available for the Arm versions of Windows for a few weeks or months before they hit the x86 versions. Windows 11 24H2 itself was also shipping on Arm PCs in stores several months before Microsoft began rolling the update out to the wider PC ecosystem. We’ve asked Microsoft to elaborate on what the Windows 11 26H1 update includes and whether it contains any changes that will benefit the wider PC ecosystem somewhere down the line. We’ll update the article if we receive a response.

Credit: Ryan Whitwam Google's Nest doorbells only save a few hours of video without a subscription. Credit: Ryan Whitwam Text settings Story text Size Small Standard Large Width * Standard Wide Links Standard Orange * Subscribers only Learn more Minimize to nav Like most cloud-enabled home security cameras, Google’s Nest products don’t provide long-term storage unless you pay a monthly fee. That video may not vanish into the digital aether right on time, though. Investigators involved with the high-profile abduction of Nancy Guthrie have released video from Guthrie’s Nest doorbell camera—video that was believed to have been deleted because Guthrie wasn’t paying for the service. Google’s cameras connect to the recently upgraded Home Premium subscription service. For $10 per month, you get 30 days of stored events, and $20 gets you 60 days of events with 10 days of the full video. If you don’t pay anything, Google only saves three hours of event history. After that, the videos are deleted, at least as far as the user is concerned. Newer Nest cameras have limited local storage that can cache clips for a few hours in case connectivity drops out, but there is no option for true local storage. Guthrie’s camera was reportedly destroyed by the perpetrators. Suspect in abduction approaches doorbell camera. Expired videos are no longer available to the user, and Google won’t restore them even if you later upgrade to a premium account. However, that doesn’t mean the data is truly gone. Nancy Guthrie was abducted from her home in the early hours of February 1, and at first, investigators said there was no video of the crime because the doorbell camera was not on a paid account. Yet, video showing a masked individual fiddling with the camera was published on February 10. The first video shows the person approaching the door and noticing the doorbell camera. They place their hand over the lens and appear to pull on the mounting bracket. Nest doorbell cameras have a small security screw that makes it difficult to remove them without causing damage. In the second video, the individual seems to try to drape a plant over the camera to block its view. Both videos are short, which is what you’d expect from an “event” as identified by the Google Home system. Suspect attempts to cover the camera with a plant. In statements made by investigators, the video was apparently “recovered from residual data located in backend systems.” It’s unclear how long such data is retained or how easy it is for Google to access it. Some reports claim that it took several days for Google to recover the data. In large-scale enterprise storage solutions, “deleted” for the user doesn’t always mean that the data is gone. Data that is no longer needed is often compressed and overwritten only as needed. In the meantime, it may be possible to recover the data. That’s something a company like Google could decide to do on its own, or it could be compelled to perform the recovery by a court order. In the Guthrie case, it sounds like Google was voluntarily cooperating with the investigation, which makes sense. Publishing video of the alleged perpetrator could be a major breakthrough as investigators seek help from the public. It’s not your cloud There is a temptation to ascribe some malicious intent to Google’s video storage setup. After all, this video expired after three hours, but here it is nine days later. That feels a bit suspicious on the surface, particularly for a company that is so focused on training AI models that feed on video. We have previously asked Google to explain how it uses Nest to train AI models, and the company claims it does not incorporate user videos into training data, but the way you interact with the service and with your videos is fair game. “We may use your inputs, including prompts and feedback, usage, and outputs from interactions with AI features to further research, tune, and train Google’s generative models, machine learning technologies, and related products and services,” Google said. If we take Google at its word, it has no incentive to keep “deleted” user videos around. If no one is paying for the storage, keeping it only costs the company money. Still, this is something to keep in mind if you’re using a Google camera. Even if you aren’t paying for storage, every event recorded by the camera is going to Google’s servers, and it’s probably recoverable long past the deletion timeline stipulated in the company’s policy. If this concerns you, there are still traditional “DVR” security cameras, which record footage to dedicated local storage. Many NAS boxes also have support for storing and managing video from select security cameras. If you’re sending video to the cloud, you can’t expect it to be totally gone even if you no longer have access to it. When Google announced its big Gemini-powered Home revamp late last year, we asked whether it retained any user video beyond the limits specified in its plans. Representatives did not address the substance of the question at the time. We’ve again asked Google to clarify its storage policy for user videos, as well as the circumstances in which it might recover “deleted” videos. The company has not responded as of this posting.

Credit: Getty Images | Kevin Dietsch Text settings Story text Size Small Standard Large Width * Standard Wide Links Standard Orange * Subscribers only Learn more Minimize to nav The National Labor Relations Board abandoned a Biden-era complaint against SpaceX after a finding that the agency does not have jurisdiction over Elon Musk’s space company. The US labor board said SpaceX should instead be regulated under the Railway Labor Act, which governs labor relations at railroad and airline companies. The Railway Labor Act is enforced by a separate agency, the National Mediation Board, and has different rules than the National Labor Relations Act enforced by the NLRB. For example, the Railway Labor Act has an extensive dispute-resolution process that makes it difficult for railroad and airline employees to strike. Employers regulated under the Railway Labor Act are exempt from the National Labor Relations Act. In January 2024, an NLRB regional director alleged in a complaint that SpaceX illegally fired eight employees who, in an open letter, criticized CEO Musk as a “frequent source of embarrassment.” The complaint sought reinstatement of the employees, back pay, and letters of apology to the fired employees. SpaceX responded by suing the NLRB, claiming the labor agency’s structure is unconstitutional. But a different issue SpaceX raised later—that it is a common carrier, like a rail company or airline—is what compelled the NLRB to drop its case. US regulators ultimately decided that SpaceX should be treated as a “common carrier by air” and “a carrier by air transporting mail” for the government. SpaceX deemed a common carrier In a February 6 letter to attorneys who represent the fired employees, NLRB Regional Director Danielle Pierce said the agency would defer to a National Mediation Board opinion that SpaceX is a common carrier: In the course of the investigation and litigation of this case, a question was presented as to whether the Employer’s operations fall within the jurisdiction of the Railway Labor Act (“RLA”) rather than the [National Labor Relations] Act. As a result, consistent with Board law, the matter was referred to the National Mediation Board (“NMB”) on May 21, 2025 for an opinion as to whether the Employer is covered by the RLA. On January 14, 2026, the NMB issued its decision finding that the Employer is subject to the RLA as a common carrier by air engaged in interstate or foreign commerce as well as a carrier by air transporting mail for or under contract with the United States Government. Accordingly, the National Labor Relations Board lacks jurisdiction over the Employer and, therefore, I am dismissing your charge. The letter was provided to Ars today by Anne Shaver, an attorney for the fired SpaceX employees. “The Railway Labor Act does not apply to space travel,” Shaver told Ars. “It is alarming that the NMB would take the initiative to radically expand the RLA’s jurisdiction to space travel absent direction from Congress, and that the NLRB would simply defer. We find the decision to be contrary to law and public policy.” We contacted the NLRB today and will update this article if it provides a response. The NLRB decision was previously reported by Bloomberg and The New York Times. “Jennifer Abruzzo, NLRB general counsel under former President Joe Biden, had rejected SpaceX’s claim that allegations against the company should be handled by the NMB,” Bloomberg wrote. “After President Donald Trump fired her in January last year, SpaceX asked the labor board to reconsider the issue.” NLRB looked for way to settle In April 2025, SpaceX and the NLRB told a federal appeals court in a joint filing that the NLRB would ask the NMB to decide whether it had jurisdiction over SpaceX. The decision to seek the NMB’s opinion was made “in the interests of potentially settling the legal disputes currently pending between the NLRB and SpaceX on terms mutually agreeable to both parties,” the joint filing said. Shaver provided a July 2025 filing that the employees’ attorneys made with the NMB. The filing said that despite SpaceX claiming to hold itself out to the public as a common carrier through its website and certain marketing materials, the firm doesn’t actually carry passengers without “a negotiated, bespoke contract.” “SpaceX’s descriptions of its transport activities are highly misleading,” the filing said. “First, regarding human spaceflight, other than sending astronauts to the ISS on behalf of the US and foreign governments, it has only ever agreed to contract with two very wealthy, famous entrepreneurs. The Inspiration4 and Polaris Dawn missions were both for Jared Isaacman, CEO of Shift4 and President Trump’s former pick to lead NASA prior to his public falling out with SpaceX CEO Elon Musk. Fram2 was for Chun Wang, a cryptocurrency investor who reportedly paid $55 million per seat. A total of two private customers for human spaceflight does not a common carrier make.” The letter said that SpaceX redacted pricing information from marketing materials it submitted as exhibits. “If these were actually marketing materials provided to the public, there would be no need to redact pricing information,” the filing said. “SpaceX’s redactions underscore that it provides such materials at its discretion to select recipients, not to the public at large—far from the conduct of a true common carrier.” The ex-employees’ attorneys further argued that SpaceX is not engaged in interstate or foreign commerce as defined by the Railway Labor Act. “SpaceX’s transport activities are not between one state or territory and another, nor between a state or territory and a foreign nation, nor between points in the same state but through another state. Rather, they originate in Florida, Texas, or California, and go to outer space,” the filing said. Spaceflight company and… mail carrier? The filing also disputed SpaceX’s argument that it is a “carrier by air transporting mail for or under contract with the United States Government.” Evidence presented by SpaceX shows only that it carried SpaceX employee letters to the crew of the International Space Station and “crew supplies provided for by the US government in its contracts with SpaceX to haul cargo to the ISS,” the filing said. “They do not show that the government has contracted with SpaceX as a ‘mail carrier.’” SpaceX’s argument “is rife with speculation regarding its plans for the future,” the ex-employees’ attorneys told the NMB. “One can only surmise that the reason for its constant reference to its future intent to develop its role as a ‘common carrier’ is the lack of current standing in that capacity.” The filing said Congress would have to add space travel to the Railway Labor Act’s jurisdiction in order for SpaceX to be considered a common carrier. When asked about plans for appeal, Shaver noted that they have a pending case in US District Court for the Central District of California: Holland-Thielen et al v. SpaceX and Elon Musk. “The status of that case is that we defeated SpaceX’s motion to compel arbitration at the district court level, and that is now on appeal to the 9th circuit,” she said. SpaceX’s lawsuit against the NLRB is still ongoing at the US Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit, but the case was put on hold while the sides waited for the NMB and NLRB to decide which agency has jurisdiction over SpaceX.

Credit: Apple Text settings Story text Size Small Standard Large Width * Standard Wide Links Standard Orange * Subscribers only Learn more Minimize to nav Apple has just released the latest major updates for iOS 26, iPadOS 26, macOS 26 Tahoe, and all the other operating systems it released back in September of 2025. The 26.3 updates for these operating systems are fairly mild, focusing mostly on bug fixes and security patches, but Apple is adding a handful of iPhone features designed to make it easier to use third-party devices in Apple’s ecosystem. The first is a “transfer to Android” feature that will facilitate switching away from Apple’s phones into the Android ecosystem. Apple offers to transfer “photos, messages, notes, apps, and more,” as well as the user’s phone number, but won’t transfer things like Bluetooth pairing information or sensitive data from the Health app. Whether third-party apps can have their data transferred is likely tied to the AppMigrationKit developer framework that Apple added in iOS 26.1. Apps using this framework can import and export data to and from other devices and also access and download content the app has stored in the cloud. Apple notes that AppMigrationKit only functions for transfers from an Apple device to a non-Apple device; Apple already has several systems in place for preserving and transferring data and settings when upgrading from one iPhone to another. The transfer system will rely on the target Android phone also supporting the feature; on Google’s end, the Data Transfer API was only added in the recent “QPR2” update to Android 16, released in early December. Android phone makers are considerably better about updates than they used to be, but it will still take time for a critical mass of even the newest non-Pixel Android devices to get this update. Apple released a “Move to iOS” Android app back in 2015 to make switching to the iPhone easier and away from Android. Doubtlessly, that’s still the direction Apple hopes most switches will go. But as with Android’s gradually improving support for AirDrop, better interoperability is a pretty straightforward win for users. Other additions, and other OSes Another iOS 26.3 update is also aimed at interoperability, though it may only apply to iPhones covered by European Union regulations. A feature called “notification forwarding” will send your iPhone’s notifications to third-party accessories, including Google’s Android-based Wear OS smartwatches. Once the setting is enabled, users will be able to decide which apps can forward notifications to the third-party device, similar to how Apple Watch notifications work. In current betas, Apple allows notifications to be forwarded to only one device at a time, and forwarding notifications to a third-party device means you can’t send them to an Apple Watch. Finally, both iOS 26.3 and iPadOS 26.3 are introducing a feature for some newer devices with Apple’s in-house C1 and C1X modems: a “limit precise location” toggle that Apple says “enhances your location privacy by reducing the precision of location data available to cellular networks.” This feature is currently only available on a handful of devices and even fewer carriers: In the US, Boost Mobile is the only one. Only the iPhone Air, iPhone 16e, or the M5 iPad Pro will offer the toggle; devices like the iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, and older phones with Qualcomm or Intel modems won’t support the feature. Apple has also updated all of its other major operating systems today. But macOS 26.3, iPadOS 26.3, watchOS 26.3, tvOS 26.3, visionOS 26.3 and version 26.3 of the HomePod software are all quieter updates of the bug-fixes-and-performance-improvements variety. Beta testers have found early evidence of support for the M5 Max and M5 Ultra chips, pointing to pending refreshes for some higher-end Macs, but that doesn’t tell us much we didn’t already know. The 26.3 updates are mostly sleepy, but the 26.4 releases may be a bigger deal. These are said to be the first to include Apple’s “more intelligent Siri,” a feature initially promised as part of the first wave of Apple Intelligence updates in iOS 18 but delayed after it failed to meet Apple’s quality standards. Apple and Google jointly announced in January that the new Siri would be powered by Google’s Gemini language models rather than OpenAI’s ChatGPT or other competing models. As with other Apple Intelligence features, we’d expect the new Siri to be available to testers via Apple’s developer and public beta programs before being released to all devices.

The demonstration “marks a significant breakthrough in the development of [China’s] manned lunar exploration program,” the China Manned Space Agency (CMSA) said in a statement. China and the United States are racing to accomplish the next human landing on the Moon in a competition for national prestige and lunar resources. The Long March 10 rocket and Mengzhou spacecraft, both tested Tuesday, are core elements of China’s lunar architecture. The launch of a subscale version of the Long March 10 rocket, still in development, provided engineers with an opportunity to verify the performance of an important part of the new Mengzhou capsule’s safety system. The test began with liftoff of the Long March 10 booster from a new launch pad at Wenchang Space Launch Site on Hainan Island, China’s southernmost province, at 10 pm EST Tuesday (03:00 UTC or 11 am Beijing time Wednesday). A test version of the Mengzhou spacecraft, flying without anyone onboard, climbed into the stratosphere on top of the Long March booster before activating its launch abort motors a little more than a minute into the flight as the rocket reached the moment of maximum aerodynamic pressure, known as Max-Q. The abort motors pulled the capsule away from the booster, simulating an in-flight escape that might be necessary to whisk crews away from a failing rocket. The Mengzhou spacecraft later deployed parachutes and splashed down offshore from Hainan Island. NASA and SpaceX performed similar in-flight abort tests before flying astronauts on the Orion and Dragon spacecraft. The test boosters on the Orion and Dragon abort tests were expended, but the Long March 10 rocket wasn’t finished after the Mengzhou abort command. Remarkably, the booster continued its ascent without the crew capsule, soaring into space on the power of its kerosene-fueled YF-100 engines before reentering the atmosphere, reigniting its engines, and nailing a propulsive landing in the South China Sea, right next to a recovery barge waiting to bring it back to shore. “The rocket’s first stage and the spacecraft’s return capsule were safely splashed down in the designated sea area according to procedures,” CMSA said. A recap video released by Chinese state television shows highlights from the test flight. One test, two goals In a matter of minutes, Chinese engineers moved closer to human-rating the Mengzhou crew capsule and achieved the country’s most successful test of a reusable rocket. “The test successfully verified the functional performance of the rocket’s first stage ascent and recovery phases, as well as the maximum dynamic pressure escape and recovery of the spacecraft,” CMSA said. “It also verified the compatibility of relevant interfaces across various engineering systems, accumulating valuable flight data and engineering experience for subsequent manned lunar exploration missions.” The low-altitude demonstration of the Mengzhou launch abort system follows a ground-level abort test last year that verified the spacecraft’s ability to escape an emergency on the launch pad. The Long March 10 booster also completed two test-firings on the launch pad prior to the in-flight abort test. At the same time, Chinese engineers have run a prototype lunar lander through a series of ground tests. The Mengzhou spacecraft is the vehicle China will use to ferry astronauts from the Earth to the vicinity of the Moon, where crews will transfer into a lander to carry them to the lunar surface. After a short stay on the Moon, Chinese astronauts will take off and rendezvous with the Mengzhou capsule to bring them home. Chinese officials say the Mengzhou spacecraft will also service the country’s space station in low-Earth orbit, replacing the Shenzhou capsule in use since the 1990s. The Mengzhou capsule has the capability for “multiple reuses,” according to CMSA. Mengzhou flights to low-Earth orbit will carry crews of up to seven astronauts, with smaller crews for lunar missions.

Credit: Liu Yang/VCG via Getty Images Mengzhou, which means “dream vessel” in Chinese, is scheduled for its first orbital test flight later this year. The spacecraft will launch on a Long March 10A rocket and dock with China’s Tiangong space station in low-Earth orbit. The Long March 10A, optimized for low-Earth orbit flights, will consist of a single reusable first-stage booster flying in combination with an upper stage. The full-size Long March 10, with 21 engines on three first-stage boosters connected together, will have the power to place payloads up to 70 metric tons into low-Earth orbit, and enough energy to propel the 26-metric-ton Mengzhou spacecraft to the Moon. China’s leading state-owned space industry contractor, the China Aerospace and Science Technology Corporation (CASC), said the recovery of the Long March 10 booster after the in-flight abort test lays the foundation for “subsequent full-profile flight tests” and marks a “significant step” for China in “mastering reusable rocket technology.” “The flight test further evaluated several key technologies, including the reliability of multiple engine restarts and high-altitude ignition during the rocket’s reentry phase, adaptability to complex force and thermal environments, and high-precision navigation control during the reentry phase.” CASC oversees a sprawling industry of rocket and spacecraft manufacturers, including those responsible for designing and building the Mengzhou spacecraft and Long March 10 rocket.

Credit: China Manned Space Agency The Mengzhou capsule splashes down in the South China Sea after the in-flight abort test. Credit: China Manned Space Agency The successful splashdown and recovery of the Long March 10 booster continues a busy period for China’s reusable rocket initiatives. No fewer than 10 Chinese companies are working on reusable rockets at different levels of maturity, all seeking to match the success of SpaceX’s reusable rocket program in the United States. In December, two Chinese launch providers debuted new rockets—the Zhuque-3 and Long March 12A—with recoverable and reusable boosters. The rockets reached orbit, but their boosters missed their landings downrange from their launch pads. Several Chinese companies have also completed high-altitude “hop tests” to evaluate vertical takeoff and vertical landing technologies ahead of launching their first orbital flights. These advancements in China’s reusable rocket and lunar exploration programs come as NASA prepares to launch a crew of four astronauts on a loop around the far side of the Moon as soon as next month. A US-made lunar lander is likely still a few years away from being ready to transport crews to and from the lunar surface.

Andrew Cunningham – Feb 11, 2026 1:18 pm | 37 Apple's Home app. Credit: nurPhoto / Getty Images Apple's Home app. Credit: nurPhoto / Getty Images Text settings Story text Size Small Standard Large Width * Standard Wide Links Standard Orange * Subscribers only Learn more Minimize to nav In 2022, Apple announced it was adopting a “new Home architecture” for its smart home ecosystem to improve its performance and reliability and make it possible to support different kinds of accessories. Although it was mostly an invisible update when it worked properly, some users who attempted to switch to the new architecture when it first rolled out in iOS 16.2 ran into slow or unresponsive devices and other problems, prompting Apple to pause the rollout and re-release it as part of iOS 16.4. If you put off transitioning to the new architecture because of those early teething problems or for some other reason, Apple is forcing the issue starting today: You’ll need to update to the new Home architecture if you want to continue using the Home app, and older iOS and macOS versions that don’t support the new architecture will no longer be able to control your smart home devices. The old version of the Home app and the old Home/HomeKit architecture are no longer supported. If you’re like me, you hit an “upgrade” button in your Home app years ago and then mostly forgot about it—if you open the Home app on a modern iPhone, iPad, or Mac and don’t see an update prompt, it means you’re already using the updated architecture and don’t need to worry about it. For those who haven’t upgraded, Apple’s support document outlines what you need to do: Make sure every device you plan to use the Home app on is running a supported operating system (“iOS 16.2, iPadOS 16.2, macOS 13.1, tvOS 16.2, or watchOS 9.2 or later”), open the Home app, and tap the update prompt. Apple says that some users “may be automatically upgraded to the latest version of Apple Home,” but it didn’t specify under what circumstances an automatic switch will happen. Apple has never gone into explicit detail on just what the updated Home architecture does, but the additions the company has made to its Home (formerly HomeKit) ecosystem in the last couple of years generally work only with the updated architecture and app. According to Apple’s support page, that includes “guest access, robot vacuum cleaners, and Activity History in the Home app.” For features that require a “home hub,” like sharing control of a home with other Apple users, receiving notifications, or adding accessories compatible with the Matter smart home standard, switching to the new architecture will also require you to have a HomePod (either full-sized or mini) or a modern Apple TV box on your network. The old version of Home/HomeKit allowed iPads to function as home hubs, but they can’t be used that way with the new architecture.

The EPA is revoking the finding for legal, not scientific, reasons. Marianne Lavelle, Inside Climate News – Feb 11, 2026 10:10 am | 105 Credit: Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post via Getty Images Credit: Jabin Botsford/The Washington Post via Getty Images Text settings Story text Size Small Standard Large Width * Standard Wide Links Standard Orange * Subscribers only Learn more Minimize to nav Following three of the warmest years on record, as scientists reckon with climate tipping points and states and cities grapple with the escalating cost of extreme weather and more intense wildfires, the Trump administration this week is expected to formally eliminate the US government’s role in controlling greenhouse gas pollution. By revoking its 17-year-old scientific finding that greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare, the Environmental Protection Agency will demolish the legal underpinning of its authority to act on climate change under the Clean Air Act. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin will be alongside President Donald Trump for an event Wednesday focused on boosting US use of coal, as mercury and air toxics standards are repealed. That is expected to be a prelude to Zeldin finalizing the endangerment finding repeal, an assignment the president handed him in an executive order signed on the first day of his second term in office. “President Trump will be taking the most significant deregulatory actions in history to further unleash American energy dominance and drive down costs,” White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said Tuesday. The move marks a far more radical retreat on climate change compared to the steps to weaken regulations that were taken in Trump’s first term. Instead, Zeldin’s team has asserted that the EPA never had the power to write such rules to begin with. Climate action advocates and Democrat-led states have vowed to challenge the repeal of the endangerment finding, a decision that not only erases President Joe Biden’s most important climate regulations, but is designed to make it more difficult for any future administration to rein in fossil fuel pollution from vehicles, power plants, or other industries. “Communities across the country will bear the brunt of this decision—through dirtier air, higher health costs, and increased climate harm,” said Michelle Roos, executive director of the Environmental Protection Network, a group of former EPA employees, in a statement. “The Trump EPA is surrendering its responsibility, turning its back on families and communities already facing the highest pollution and health risks, and dismantling decades of science and progress.” Said Joseph Goffman, EPA’s top air official during the Biden administration, “This move is a fundamental betrayal of EPA’s responsibility to protect human health. It is legally indefensible, morally bankrupt, and completely untethered from the scientific record.” The battle seems destined to land in the Supreme Court, forcing it to revisit its landmark 2007 ruling that greenhouse gases were pollutants under the Clean Air Act. The outcome of a legal challenge is by no means clear, with all five of the justices who formed the majority in that case, Massachusetts v. EPA, dead or retired. To help readers sort through the meaning of the highly technical legal maneuver by the Trump administration, and look to what comes next, Inside Climate News tackled some of the key questions raised by the reversal of the endangerment finding: Does this mean that scientists now think climate change is not a problem? A panel of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) put it bluntly: “The evidence for current and future harm to human health and welfare created by human-caused [greenhouse gases] is beyond scientific dispute,” the scientists said in a report submitted to the EPA as it launched its repeal process. They said that the endangerment finding that the Obama administration adopted in 2009 is now supported by longer observational records and multiple new lines of evidence. The most recent National Climate Assessment in 2023 reported that temperatures in the contiguous United States had increased by 2.5° F (1.4° C) since 1970, a marked increase from the 1.3° F (0.7° C) warming over the 20th century that the EPA reported in 2009. Annual heat-wave frequency has tripled since the 1960s, storms are producing more intense rains, and wildfires have become more severe. Hurricanes have been intensifying more rapidly since the early 1980s, and they break up slower. “Multiple lines of evidence show that greenhouse gas emissions from human activities are the primary driver of the observed long-term warming trend and other changes in Earth’s energy balance,” the NASEM panel said. “Natural forces cannot account for observed changes.” The Trump administration didn’t ask NASEM for input, even though the Clean Air Act indicates that the EPA should consult with the National Academies on scientific issues. Instead, NASEM had to self-fund and fast-track its work to meet the tight deadline set for public comment last September. The group noted that it worked in the wake of a slew of climate-driven disasters in the United States: “the heavy rainfall of Hurricane Helene that destroyed homes and roads in the mountains of North Carolina, the fast-moving wildfires that displaced thousands in Los Angeles and affected air quality for miles around, and the rapid flooding of the Guadalupe River in central Texas that led to at least 135 fatalities.” Such manifestations, and analytical methods that have allowed researchers to attribute them to climate change, are the most significant evolution in climate understanding since 2009, said Phil Duffy, chief scientist for the nonprofit group Spark Climate Solutions. “The evidence for societal harms from greenhouse gas emissions has become more of a present day reality than something that’s predicted and expected,” he said. Duffy, a top science adviser to President Joe Biden, was not involved in the NASEM report but was author of a peer-reviewed 2019 study that also found the scientific support for the endangerment finding had withstood the test of time. When asked about the National Academies’ work, the EPA has stressed that its decision was based on new legal doctrines. In its proposal last year, the EPA asserted that the uncertainties “are more significant than previously believed,” and that “the more pessimistic assumptions” in the 2009 finding have not been borne out. “We expect EPA to revoke the endangerment finding for legal reasons, not scientific ones.” — Jeff Holmstead, a former EPA official It was not immediately clear whether the agency, in its final proposal, would continue to lean on the well-worn science denial talking points compiled by the so-called “Climate Working Group,” five prominent climate skeptics hand-picked by Energy Secretary Chris Wright, a former oil executive, as advisors for the endangerment finding repeal process. More than 85 climate scientists submitted a report to the EPA detailing errors in the Climate Working Group’s report, and a federal judge ruled that Wright broke the law in establishing the group without regard to the Federal Advisory Committee Act’s transparency and fairness provisions. In its original proposal, the Trump EPA relied on recent Supreme Court decisions it said restrict its authority to act on climate under current law, and close observers expect that will be the administration’s strategy. “We expect EPA to revoke the endangerment finding for legal reasons, not scientific ones,” said Jeff Holmstead, a partner at the Bracewell law firm who served as head of EPA’s air office during President George W. Bush’s administration. “This is the only way that they can ‘drive a stake through the heart of climate religion,’ as Administrator Zeldin has said.” If this is about law and not science, how has the law changed since 2009? The second Trump administration had the confidence to take on the endangerment finding largely because of how the president reshaped the Supreme Court in his first term, legal experts say. In two 6-3 decisions from a conservative majority bolstered by Trump’s three appointees, the justices created new doctrine that limited the power of federal regulatory agencies like the EPA. “We’ve had an administrative law revolution,” said industry lawyer Matthew Leopold, who was the EPA’s general counsel in Trump’s first term, speaking at a forum last fall at the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), a conservative think tank. “The playing field that the Obama administration was playing on [when it made the endangerment finding] looks entirely different today.” The Supreme Court struck down Obama’s signature climate policy, the Clean Power Plan, in 2022. And in that case, West Virginia v. EPA, the court established its so-called “major questions doctrine,” saying regulation of greenhouse gases was an issue of such great economic and political significance that the EPA could not regulate them without explicit direction from Congress. Then, in a 2024 case over fishing regulations, the Supreme Court overturned the principle that had guided regulatory law for 40 years, saying that federal agencies were due no deference in interpreting ambiguities in the law. The court said judges, not agencies, should decide the meaning of the law, even though in the environmental realm that typically involves application of science and knowledge of the best available technologies for reining in pollution. Climate action advocates, however, argue that the Trump administration faces an uphill battle in defending its repeal of the endangerment finding, largely because the Supreme Court already has interpreted the Clean Air Act as applying to greenhouse gases—in Massachusetts v. EPA. The court has repeatedly declined efforts to overturn that precedent, including in the West Virginia v. EPA case. “To be sure… the court limited precisely how EPA may regulate those pollutants, but even the current court has not challenged whether EPA may do so,” said David Doniger, senior attorney and strategist for the Natural Resources Defense Council, at a briefing for reporters several weeks before the decision was announced. Doniger’s colleague, Meredith Hankins, legal director for NRDC’s climate program, says the Trump EPA is clearly relying on legal strategy since it can not offer a scientific rationale for repealing the endangerment finding. “Since EPA’s attempts to make up their own climate science has been laughed out of the room, the agency is left trying to make these tortured legal arguments that do not stand up to the slightest scrutiny,” she said. Both The Washington Post and POLITICO reported in late January that debate within the administration over the EPA’s legal approach was delaying the process. Outside the administration, even lawyers who supported the move to overturn the endangerment finding acknowledged the challenges. “They are working to break the tool itself,” said Michael Buschbacher, a top attorney in litigation against greenhouse gas standards for vehicles, speaking at the AEI endangerment finding forum. Buschbacher said the many potential pitfalls make it “like a regulatory Everest … It’s dangerous. It’s a high-risk, high-reward endeavor.” The Trump administration’s best chance of scaling that mountain is if it can make it to the Supreme Court, he said: “That’s probably where this is going to go if this administration is going to prevail.” So is this “final” decision really final? Not in the least. The EPA’s regulatory determinations are challenged in court more than those of any other federal agency, according to tracking by the Institute for Policy Integrity at New York University, and this high-stakes decision will not be an exception. Climate action advocates see the endangerment finding as a key line they must defend in what they see as the extraordinary all-out assault on environmental protection in the second Trump term. “Put simply, this is a gift-wrapped package for the fossil fuel industry,” said Manish Bapma, CEO of NRDC. “It is unscientific, it is bad economics, and it is illegal. So we’re gonna fight it.” The first stop will be the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, which has exclusive jurisdiction over appeals of nationally applicable regulations. Seven of the 11 judges on that court were appointed by Presidents Obama or Biden. How hard would it be for a future administration to restore the finding that greenhouse gas emissions are a danger to human health and the environment? It depends on the courts. If Massachusetts v. EPA is still standing at the end of the battle, the EPA will still have the power to regulate greenhouse gas emissions, like an arrow in its quiver that it just has to decide to use. But if the Supreme Court were to rule the Clean Air Act gives the EPA no authority over greenhouse gas emissions—reversing the Massachusetts decision and perhaps later cases that relied upon it—that leaves future administrations with an empty quiver. “Then there would be the problem of a lack of authority, unless Congress wrote a new law,” said Doniger of NRDC. But it has been more than two decades since a bipartisan consensus on climate action seemed fleetingly within reach in Congress. Congressional action has grown more elusive even as public support for action—especially deployment of clean energy—has grown. Democrats were able to get a $390 billion investment in clean energy, the Inflation Reduction Act, passed without GOP support in 2022. The Biden climate plan was a carrot-and-stick approach to drive the United States to cut its carbon emissions 50 percent by 2030. The IRA’s incentives and subsidies were meant to drive down the price of clean energy, while EPA regulation pushed industry to make a transition away from fossil fuels. But over the past year, Trump and the Republican Congress have clawed back the IRA’s carrots. By revoking its endangerment finding, the EPA will also drop its stick. Holmstead argued that withdrawal of the endangerment finding might actually force Congress to try to reach a bipartisan agreement on climate legislation: “The business community would like to have the long-term certainty that would come with bipartisan legislation, and if the environmental community sees that it can’t get what it wants from EPA, they might be more willing to make the kind of compromises that are always required to pass meaningful legislation.” But Holmstead added that he did not expect that to happen during the Trump administration. No matter the outcome of the coming litigation over the endangerment finding repeal, the fossil fuel industry has won time. The Trump administration has ensured that the nation that has contributed the most to the atmosphere’s overload of climate pollution, the United States, will be entangled in litigation during years that scientists have said are crucial for driving down the pollution that is increasing risks and costs for communities as it alters the planet.

In its notice, the FAA also restricted air space extended in a radius of 10 nautical miles from the airport. Violators were subject to being shot down, the agency said. However, less than 10 hours later and without any additional explanation, the FAA ended the restrictions. “The temporary closure of airspace over El Paso has been lifted,” the federal agency said on social media. “There is no threat to commercial aviation. All flights will resume as normal.” Later on Wednesday morning, Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy said the decision to close airspace was made to counteract drones from cartels. “The FAA and DOW acted swiftly to address a cartel drone incursion,” Duffy wrote on X. “The threat has been neutralized, and there is no danger to commercial travel in the region.” Creating confusion In announcing the closure on Tuesday night, the FAA offered no explanation for the closure aside from determining that the area was classified as “national defense airspace,” and adding that the United States government may use “deadly force” against any airborne aircraft. According to reporting from The New York Times, local officials in El Paso and statewide were not given advance notice for the air space closure. Similarly, in announcing an end to the restrictions, the federal agency offered no immediate information to local officials or travelers who were inconvenienced. It is rare for airspace over a major airport to be closed for any extended period. The El Paso airport serves more than 3 million customers a month, and according to the 2020 US Census, it lies in the 22nd most populous city in the United States. El Paso is located along the US border with Mexico, across the Rio Grande River from Ciudad Juárez, a city of 1.5 million people. The initial lack of communication from federal officials regarding such a disruptive closure, and then its abrupt end, raised serious questions about the coordination among federal agencies, especially if the FAA was making the closure on behalf of another federal body, such as the US Department of Defense. This story was updated at 10:50 am ET to reflect the most recent statement from Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy.

Gitlin – Feb 11, 2026 7:00 am | 69 Credit: Getty Images Credit: Getty Images Text settings Story text Size Small Standard Large Width * Standard Wide Links Standard Orange * Subscribers only Learn more Minimize to nav A long time ago, in (I believe) an issue of Car Magazine from the mid-1990s, the designer Gordon Murray shared his thoughts about a possible four-door follow-up to the McLaren F1. Road cars weren’t really his thing. Until then, his career had been focused on Formula 1 car design, and he brought that sport’s obsession with weight savings with him. Were he to design a sedan, he’d trim the interior with textile, not leather. After all, wool made fine suits and coats, Murray reasoned, and it would save weight. A four-door McLaren never happened during his tenure, nor has one appeared since. Murray now runs his own boutique hypercar company, which also builds no sedans. But the idea that high-end cars could use something other than leather has stuck with me, especially after driving BMW’s i7, which debuted in 2022 with a premium cashmere wool interior. More recently, new EVs have experimented with interesting textile alternatives to leather. Two good examples are the BMW iX3 and the Audi A6, though neither can be ordered with these textile options in the US. It’s hardly the first time US-market cars have had different options. Our Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards insist on features like side reflectors, which Europe doesn’t need, and we maintain somewhat old headlight rules. You’re also unlikely to see any of the smaller-engined versions of luxury cars from German brands being offered for North American consumption. But it did make me wonder why we’re being left in the cold. Here’s what they said When we saw a preview of the new Audi A6 in mid-2024, we were told this textile trim would not be coming to America. Credit: Audi When we saw a preview of the new Audi A6 in mid-2024, we were told this textile trim would not be coming to America. Credit: Audi We’re used to American Audis being a bit different. We couldn’t have the R8’s laser high beam headlights or the A6’s OLED animated taillights, and we’re not getting the station wagon version of that car, the A6 Avant, at all. Or the A5 Avant. I reached out to the automaker to ask why it didn’t think its American customers would go for the textile trim. An Audi USA spokesperson told Ars that “while we applaud the sustainable factor of cloth seats, customers continue to prefer leather/leather-like seats in luxury vehicles and note that it is easier to clean… [and] easier to get into and out of (i.e., ingress/egress as clothes sometimes cling to fabric seats).” Similarly, BMW doesn’t always bring its good stuff across this side of the Atlantic. There was no Z1, and the E36 M3 had a much lesser engine thanks to federal and Californian emissions regulations, just to pick two (admittedly old) examples. BMW told me that, like its counterpart Audi, its customers are mostly fine with synthetic leather-like alternatives to animal hides. “We continuously evaluate market trends, industry developments, and customer feedback when considering new features and materials,” a BMW spokesperson said. “Currently, our customers are very satisfied with our animal-free materials such as SensaTec and Veganza as well as our traditional leather options. While there has been some interest in textile materials, the demand has focused on more premium options like Alcantara and microfiber rather than traditional cloth. Accordingly, we have been expanding our range of these premium textile materials in recent years.” The BMW i7 feels very special. Credit: BMW The BMW i7 feels very special. Credit: BMW Think motorsports-inspired interiors and perhaps more plushness like in that i7, but it seems we shouldn’t expect eco seats woven from recycled plastics, unlike in Europe. What do US car buyers want? Every year, AutoPacific surveys more than 18,000 people planning to buy or lease a new car to gauge their interest in dozens of potential new features to pin down what American car buyers really want in their next vehicle. The market research company asked survey respondents about upholstery, though leather and animal-free alternatives were the options. “Expectedly, among shoppers who would consider buying a luxury vehicle, demand is the strongest for leather, followed by upgraded leather that may have quilting, accent stitching, or other seat design enhancements,” said Robby DeGraff, manager of product and consumer insights at AutoPacific. “When we shift away from real leather over to the alternatives and imitations, demand begins to fall, but not by much. For example, of those who said they would consider buying an Aston Martin, 32 percent want genuine leather or upgraded leather, while 31 percent of them would be a-OK with leatherette or a sustainable leatherette material.” “Dipping a bit more down the price ladder but still within the luxury space, there’s greater differences in demand for real leather versus imitation leather (sustainable or not), among future Cadillac buyers, Lexus, buyers, as well as future Porsche and Mercedes-Benz buyers,” DeGraff said. Indeed, Cadillac has always had a particularly American approach to the luxury car, and in its new Optiq electric crossover, that approach includes some cool textiles made entirely from recycled materials. It’s about meeting customers’ expectations, according to Jennifer Widrick, director of global colors, materials, and finishes at General Motors Design. “Cadillac specifically uses fabric as a distinct element to reinforce quality detailing, a connection to fashion, and interior design trends,” Widrick said. “Fabric provides added depth through multiple color yarns in precise constructions on surfaces that would otherwise be one color. Customers recognize these details as synonymous with quality and modernity.” The Cadillac Optiq opts for tactile textiles for its center console trim, among other places in the EV. Credit: Michael Teo Van Runkle The Cadillac Optiq opts for tactile textiles for its center console trim, among other places in the EV. Credit: Michael Teo Van Runkle You shouldn’t think of it as one material versus another, Widrick said. “Rather, the layering and customer appreciation of detailing is more discerning. In addition to the depth that fabric textures can bring to the surface of automotive interiors, they provide opportunity for a more conscious material approach,” she said. “Fabric has evolved for Cadillac in that it is no longer just a seating material but an element that is reaching out into other areas of the vehicle. It’s an exciting shift to see known materials placed in reimagined ways that create fresh interaction experiences for customers.” Harmony is key. “Shape, scale, haptic, and proportion are taken into consideration to tailor the fabric for a premium impression. Fabric can work in harmony or be used as a design element to move your eye throughout the interior,” Widrick said. Bring me the sheep At least one OEM understands the brief. “Take Volvo’s wool, which not only looks incredible—it feels truly incredible to sit in a seat engulfed in it. That’s a sustainable, inviting, and remarkably premium alternative to common leather that I wish more automakers would explore,” AutoPacific’s DeGraff said. “At Volvo Cars, we believe that good design, quality, and sustainability are inherently connected. Recycled and renewable materials aren’t just an option for us, they’re essential to shape a better future,” said Rekha Meena, head of colors, materials, and finishes at Volvo Cars. “Our responsibility is to blend these elements seamlessly, creating a sense of luxury and timelessness, all while ensuring that our products stand the test of time.” Like Widrick at Cadillac, Meena wants Volvo interiors to have a sense of harmony, and that’s on good display with the EX90. “When it comes to textiles, we see the versatility and strong potential to deliver all these qualities combining warmth, tactility, and refined expression in a way that enhances both the driving experience and the emotional connection to the interior,” Meena said. Volvo has a wool blend for the EX90. Credit: James Lipman/Volvo Cars Volvo has a wool blend for the EX90. Credit: James Lipman/Volvo Cars Textiles have a long tradition in Scandinavian design, where “luxury is about simplicity, honesty, and attention to detail,” Meena told Ars. “When developed with care, textile upholstery can feel refined, modern, and long-lasting. Textiles allow us to create softness and depth in ways other materials cannot, resulting in interiors that feel calm, thoughtful, and welcoming.” As for when to break away from leather, that’s up to the experience the design team wants to create for drivers. “We do not view textiles as replacements for leather or vinyl,” Meena said. “Each material has its own strengths, and customer choice remains paramount. What textiles offer, however, is something distinct: greater variation, a richer sensory experience, and a more human, approachable character.” That sense of harmony is achieved with the tailored wool blend option for Volvo’s EX90, and all four of the trim options for the affordable EX30 feature some degree of textile trim on the seats and door panels. Indeed, Volvo’s distinctive and somewhat left-field style is now as much part of the brand as its stated commitment to road safety. That’s all to say that I think it’s time for more luxury brands to get bold with their materials. A sofa or lounge chair doesn’t need animal hide to be considered stylish or luxurious, and neither does a car interior. It just needs good design. Jonathan M. Gitlin Automotive Editor Jonathan M.

Impressive in-software customization options. On par with Hall effect switches. 8,000-Hz polling rate. Simple robust build. Indicator screen is useful and entertaining.TIREDMediocre typing experience. Plastic bottom case. Some RGB troubles. Strange software decisions. Proprietary switches.A keyboard is more than the sum of its parts. To have a truly great typing experience, a lot has to come together—each aspect of a keyboard needs to be designed (or selected) with the rest of it in mind. But not every keyboard needs to strive for a great typing experience. Sometimes, they just need to get the job done. Take, for example, the Razer Huntsman V3 Pro.Nearly every decision on this keyboard is made with performance in mind, with both the sonic and tactile experience taking a backseat. Instead of the plush luxurious typing feel of a gasket-mounted keyboard with hand-lubed tactile switches and premium case materials, we have a plastic-and-metal lump fitted with ultrafast optical switches, capable of sending inputs 8,000 times every second to your PC, without a single extraneous feature to fatten it up (aside from the expected RGB lighting).I didn’t love typing on this keyboard, and I didn’t find myself itching to get it back on my desk when I took a break. But I have to admit, I quite like the tunnel-vision, gaming-only approach Razer takes. It's not for everyone, and it certainly isn’t for me.Speed Is KeyPhotograph: Henri RobbinsThe Razer Analog Optical Switches Gen-2 work fantastically. They’re responsive, easy to type on, and snap back quickly after being pressed. They have a bit of wobble, but don’t have any scratchiness or resistance—each key press feels smooth and controlled, even when pressed from the edge of the key.Razer Huntsman V3 Pro 8KHzRating: 7/10$250 $225 at Amazon$250 at Walmart$250 at Razer$250 at Best BuyUnlike gasket-mount keyboards, the Huntsman doesn’t exactly feel comfortable to type on. It’s stiff and simple, using a tray mount with a metal plate integrated into the top half of the case. The switches have a hard bottom out, without any bounce or flex when typing. Technically, the lack of flexibility is a performance benefit with ultraprecise switches in a gaming context. I’ve used some gasket-mount keyboards where a full key press would cause the internal assembly to move a not-insignificant distance, which could theoretically throw off a particularly precise input.At 8,000 hertz with hardly any input lag, key presses are almost instantaneous. A key’s actuation point can be raised high enough that even grazing the key with your finger will register an input. This can cause some issues, especially on the space bar when playing games that require precise double jumping (like Destiny 2), but once the settings are dialed in correctly, the keyboard feels incredibly intuitive and natural.Quite a few of the switches had issues with sound. Pinging is widespread across the keys and is exacerbated by the design of the tray-mount case, which sometimes picks up resonance when typing. The stabilizers are only lightly lubed from the factory, with longer keys feeling scratchier than others, with more resistance. While the stabilizer wires don’t rattle when typing, they do have a dry, plasticky sound when typing that’s different from standard keys.Strange SoftwarePhotograph: Henri RobbinsWhile I normally quite like Razer's Synapse software, I ran into quite a few hiccups with this keyboard. Nearly every key can be adjusted and customized, but two of them are stuck with their default settings no matter what. Both the Function key and the Windows key cannot be remapped with custom layouts, nor can their actuation distance be adjusted, meaning they’re both stuck with the default 1.2-mm actuation distance, even when other keys’ actuation distances can be adjusted freely. The only available option is disabling this key using “Gaming Mode” (Fn + Win).Razer Huntsman V3 Pro 8KHzRating: 7/10$250 $225 at Amazon$250 at Walmart$250 at Razer$250 at Best BuyThe screen on the right side is convenient and practical. I appreciate the gimmick of the actuation visualizer, which is a small line of dots that illuminates from left to right as you push down a key. It can help with determining and setting an ideal actuation distance, but beyond that, it’s almost entirely aesthetic. The rest of the indicators on the keyboard are nice, but they are underwhelming compared to the full OLED screens that many gaming keyboards have today.The rarely used cluster of keys above the arrow keys now has a secondary purpose, where each of them can be used with the Function layer to select one of five preset profiles. Four of them are customizable, but the first, called “Factory Default,” seemingly functions as a fail-safe in case you royally mess up another profile map (such as remapping your space bar to your controller’s “A” button—something the software actually warns you against if you attempt it).Across these profiles, you can make all of the standard Hall effect adjustments. Each key’s individual actuation distance can be adjusted, Rapid Trigger allows you to customize the key’s reset point (so you can immediately press the key down again instead of waiting for it to return past the initial actuation point), and Razer’s SOCD (Simultaneous Opposing Cardinal Direction) setting, called Snap Tap, works like any other, letting one key override another for rapid strafing.Photograph: Henri RobbinsSynapse also allows for more minute customizations, with adjustments to switch dead zones, rapid trigger sensitivity, and “Continuous Rapid Trigger,” which keeps Rapid Trigger active above the default actuation point until a key is fully released.During my time with this keyboard, I struggled quite a bit with the RGB lighting. It would regularly stop functioning at all during use, requiring me to unplug the keyboard to reset something internally. At one point, the main RGB layer stopped illuminating entirely, with only the OLED display and the illuminated Function layer (displaying which keys have functionality when Fn is pressed) maintaining their lighting. The strangest part was that the RGB lighting would return to the default setting when my computer was locked, indicating some kind of issue with the Synapse software. Ultimately, after troubleshooting quite a bit, I had to completely uninstall and reinstall both Synapse and Chroma for it to work again.Razer Huntsman V3 Pro 8KHzRating: 7/10$250 $225 at Amazon$250 at Walmart$250 at Razer$250 at Best BuyKeys on the keyboard can be remapped to game pad controls, using the analog input to replicate the variable inputs of triggers and joysticks. This works exceptionally well, even allowing for customizable input curves to fine-tune movements. I tested this primarily with racing games and didn’t run into any issues with input accuracy or response speed (however, controlling a car with a keyboard is still jarring when compared to a standard controller). The only issue with this system is that, for some reason, each button on the controller can only be mapped to one key at a time. This isn’t a huge issue, but it does seem like an unnecessary limitation.Not Pointlessly PremiumPhotograph: Henri RobbinsThe case is nothing fancy. Metal on top and plastic on the underside. Just enough metal to prevent any flex when typing and not a bit more. If you try to twist the keyboard chassis, it gives without much struggle, and for some reason, a couple of the switches even register a single millimeter of key press (which is clearly indicated on the side display).Taking apart the keyboard, there’s not too much inside. The two halves of the keyboard are held together by a handful of screws under the keycaps, and they snap together using plastic clips around the edges of the case. Once open, you’ll see two Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) attached to the top case: One housing the switches, and another containing the knob and buttons in the top right of the keyboard. On the bottom case, a ribbon cable connects the main PCB to a separate daughterboard containing the USB-C port. Between these are two sheets of foam: One thick piece that sits between each switch, and a thin one that isolates the two halves from one another.This internal assembly is simple and creates a typing experience that is consistent and rigid. Plastic supports prop up the top half of the case to prevent any flex when typing, and the foam limits extraneous noise. There are longevity issues, since the plastic clips risk snapping every time you disassemble the keyboard, and the screws are all being driven directly into plastic that can break down over time, but there is nothing that I think will cause issues if you leave this keyboard in one piece.Razer Huntsman V3 Pro 8KHzRating: 7/10$250 $225 at Amazon$250 at Walmart$250 at Razer$250 at Best BuyAs great as the optical switches are, they are entirely proprietary. This means you can’t swap them out with standard Cherry MX-style switches. The switch mechanism itself can easily be replaced with another Razer optical switch, since they snap in place with two tabs on the underside of the plate. The sensor is two small components soldered onto the PCB that would be pretty difficult to replace, but as it's rated for over 100 million actuations, failure isn’t a serious concern.Photograph: Henri RobbinsUnlike quite a few other keyboards from both Razer and other companies, which use memory foam, the wrist rest included with the Huntsman V3 Pro is entirely made of rigid plastic (with a faux leather wrap on the top surface). This makes it much more solid, without any cushioning for your wrists. This could be an upgrade or a downgrade compared to a more plush wrist rest. The material on top is comfortable, and the wrist rest is magnetized, allowing it to attach to the keyboard and not move during regular use. It’s good despite the lack of cushioning.Initially, I didn’t like this keyboard very much. Coming from my own world of custom-built keyboards with subpar specs and superb typing experiences, it was jarring. It didn’t feel great to type on, and the performance benefits of it weren’t obvious in regular day-to-day use. When editing documents or replaying Halo 3 for the 20th time, you won’t feel the benefits of 8,000 hertz or Snap Tap strafing. But once I took it into multiplayer lobbies, I was able to look past the features I initially thought were missing and experience this keyboard properly.The price feels high for something with this build quality and typing experience, but for its level of performance and accuracy, it feels a bit more reasonable. I can’t say this keyboard is perfect—there are countless things I would change to make it feel better to use—but there really aren’t any performance improvements I would make. If that’s what you really care about, if you want something with no extra frills that you can fine-tune to your preferences, this might be the right keyboard for you.Razer Huntsman V3 Pro 8KHzRating: 7/10$250 $225 at Amazon$250 at Walmart$250 at Razer$250 at Best Buy$250 $225 at Amazon$250 at Walmart$250 at Razer$250 at Best Buy"

Close Adam Breeden/ZDNETVirtual private networks (VPNs) are crucial tools for protecting your online security and privacy. At their core, VPNs are networks that encrypt your traffic, masking your IP address and adding an extra layer of security that keeps your communication private. This can stop marketers from tracking and creating profiles on you, from collecting and sharing your data, and can also help you circumvent location-based blocks. A reliable VPN can also grant you access to streaming content libraries outside your region. This is perfect when you are away from home and don't want to miss your favorite show. As a bonus, when you subscribe, you can often take advantage of additional privacy features, such as ad blockers, Dark Web breach alerts, data breach scanners, and password managers.

What is the best VPN service right now?My pick for the best VPN in 2026 is NordVPN. NordVPN offers the full package -- fast speeds, stable connections, an expansive server network, and excellent streaming capabilities. It's also easy to use with a variety of apps for your Windows, Mac, and mobile devices. Plans start at $2.69 per month.My second choice is ExpressVPN This secure VPN offers some of the best and most consistent speeds across its global servers while still being user-friendly. Expect to pay $2.44 per month on a two-year plan, and you also receive four months of free service on signup.Also: The best smart TV VPNs of 2025: Securely stream your favorite shows worldwide with the best VPNs on the marketThe ZDNET team has decades of experience in the VPN arena, and I've tested all the VPN services on this list. I rigorously evaluate them through frequent real-world speed tests and rank them based on the number of servers, security features, price, usability, and other factors important to you. If you're interested in signing up for a VPN, pick a trustworthy service that doesn't drastically impact your speed or internet connection. You should also consider the size and variety of its server network, whether or not it's right for streaming, and how the VPN provider treats user data. There appears to be a price war underway, and some subscriptions are the lowest I've seen since Black Friday last year. These are my top picks for 2026. Sort by All Countries and servers Usability Speed and performance Security Price The best VPNs of 2026 Show less View now at NordVPN NordVPN is one of the most widely used VPNs, and for most users it ticks all the boxes. This makes it my top pick overall in 2026. Why we like it: NordVPN is secure, fast, suitable for streaming, and has all the features you'll likely need. I've found it to be one of the fastest VPNs with the most consistent speed measurements and rapid initial server connectivity. While it's worth noting that rival ExpressVPN is often faster in some cases, averaging out at higher speeds with long-distance servers, NordVPN tends to perform better when you use smart, local servers. NordVPN is fine for basic use but offers many features beyond a mere VPN tunnel, including peer-to-peer (P2P) sharing support and an optional second layer of encryption through Double VPN. This allows you to set up a dedicated IP address to run a VPN that also acts as a server. In my tests with Netflix, NordVPN emerged as a top VPN for streaming content with a high success rate in accessing geo-blocked content. When set up with the Privacy Hero 2 router, it also did exceptionally well in accessing streaming services worldwide. Last year, the company launched NordWhisper, a new protocol that allows users to connect to VPN servers from networks that typically limit traditional VPN traffic and enforce restrictive network policies. In a recent service update, its macOS and Windows apps have also been refreshed. Sadly, the interactive map is now gone, but it is a much cleaner interface than before, making it easier for users to navigate.NordVPN's kill switch activates if your connection suddenly drops, protecting your connection and data. There's also a handy pause function if you need to access a local website or service and revert to your original IP address.

This makes it my top pick overall in 2026. Why we like it: NordVPN is secure, fast, suitable for streaming, and has all the features you'll likely need. I've found it to be one of the fastest VPNs with the most consistent speed measurements and rapid initial server connectivity. While it's worth noting that rival ExpressVPN is often faster in some cases, averaging out at higher speeds with long-distance servers, NordVPN tends to perform better when you use smart, local servers. NordVPN is fine for basic use but offers many features beyond a mere VPN tunnel, including peer-to-peer (P2P) sharing support and an optional second layer of encryption through Double VPN. This allows you to set up a dedicated IP address to run a VPN that also acts as a server. In my tests with Netflix, NordVPN emerged as a top VPN for streaming content with a high success rate in accessing geo-blocked content. When set up with the Privacy Hero 2 router, it also did exceptionally well in accessing streaming services worldwide. Last year, the company launched NordWhisper, a new protocol that allows users to connect to VPN servers from networks that typically limit traditional VPN traffic and enforce restrictive network policies. In a recent service update, its macOS and Windows apps have also been refreshed. Sadly, the interactive map is now gone, but it is a much cleaner interface than before, making it easier for users to navigate.NordVPN's kill switch activates if your connection suddenly drops, protecting your connection and data. There's also a handy pause function if you need to access a local website or service and revert to your original IP address.

Review: ExpressVPN: Is it worth the price?The company doesn't log your browsing history, IP address, or traffic destination and operates a no-logs policy.

I ran a series of speed and connectivity tests in February 2026 on each VPN's paid service to see how they compare.I performed the tests using a fiber connection in the U.K., with an average starting speed, without a VPN, of 776.47 Mbps download and 108.11 Mbps upload. Each smart location and U.S. connection test was repeated three times, and I then calculated the average. On rare occasions, I encountered an extreme outlier, such as horrendous speeds on a specific server outside the norm. In these instances, I repeated the test, as servers may sometimes be experiencing errors or undergoing maintenance. I also tested for the presence of domain name service (DNS) leaks.Previously, I performed repeated tests using a broadband connection in the U.K. with an average starting speed, without a VPN, of between 50 and 60 Mbps download and around 15 to 20 Mbps upload. This gave me a strong indicator of which VPNs tend to work best with slower initial broadband speeds, an important factor as not everyone has access to high-speed broadband services.Please remember that results may differ for you and vary from country to country, so the below should be considered a snapshot. Your internet service provider (ISP) and broadband subscription may also impact your speeds. The results below are not the exact speeds you should expect. You can instead use these results to get a general idea of how your speeds could change with a VPN. Remember that the further away the VPN server, the more your speed may be impacted. Speeds will typically be quicker when you connect to a local server, compared to selecting Australia, for example, unless you're in the country. Show more Which is the right VPN for you? Choose this top VPN service...If you want...NordVPNThe best VPN overall. NordVPN is one of the most consistently fast and stable VPN providers with a solid and large server network, giving you plenty of countries to connect to. It's great for streaming and travel, too, with a stylish user interface on PC and mobile.ExpressVPNOne of the fastest VPNs with a large server network. I've used ExpressVPN for years, and I consider it one of the fastest and least obtrusive services available. You can expect multi-platform support and relatively minor speed downgrades when you are streaming. It's also dropped in price in recent months, although top-tier plans are still expensive.Surfshark VPNOne of the least expensive top VPNs. Surfshark is a consistent entrant in my recommended VPN lists, and for good reason. It might not always be the fastest, but for the price point, you can't argue against its value for money. It's also perfect for beginners, has a reliable kill switch, and an intuitive UI.Proton VPNA variety of add-on features and the comfort of open-source security. Proton VPN is one of the most privacy-focused VPN services out there. It offers reasonable speeds and is one of the few trusted providers out there that also provides users with a free plan.Private Internet AccessUnlimited simultaneous connections. Private Internet Access is a great choice if you want a set-and-forget, affordable VPN, but the interface won't suit everyone, as it is rather dated. Still, this VPN will support and protect as many devices as you like under one account, including your PC, smartphone, and even your smart TV. Show more Factors to consider when choosing a VPN service These are the most important factors to consider when deciding to try a VPN or switching from your existing VPN service to another provider.Speed: Every VPN operates differently, and every user experience varies. Your ISP will offer speeds that are not the same as those of someone in another location. When you are testing a new VPN, keep your base speed in mind, and look out for VPN solutions with minimal speed loss -- especially if you are stuck on slow ISP services.Apps: VPN providers should offer compatibility for multiple platforms and operating systems. Take a look at the user interfaces, features, and compatibility offered by your chosen VPN provider before you commit.Simultaneous connections: If you're paying for a VPN, you might want to use it across multiple devices, such as a desktop PC, smartphone, or smart TV. We recommend you sign up for a plan supporting at least six devices, and thankfully, most paid plans now offer at least that many.Trial periods: Before committing to a VPN provider, test them out, that's what money-back guarantees are for. Remember that most VPN providers will give you 30 days to cancel and secure a refund. Some even offer up to 45 days.Free VPN providers: Running VPN infrastructure is expensive. If the VPN provider doesn't make money from your service fees, they're going to make money from you somehow -- sometimes even by selling your personal information. Stick with the trusted commercial vendors we've tested or the handful of free plans we recommend. There are also cases where \"free\" VPNs undermine what the software is designed for: data protection and security. Contract terms: VPN providers constantly offer discounts, typically on longer-term plans. Consider the fine print before you sign up. Remember to cancel before automatic renewal if you're no longer happy with the service or want to switch to a cheaper deal elsewhere. Use cases: Your VPN selection should relate to how you want to use a VPN. For example, you may want one specifically for streaming geo-locked content, or you may need a VPN that is likely to work in restricted countries. Consider these points before making your final choice, and test them out during your money-back guarantee period to ensure the VPN is right for you.Advanced features: You might like the idea of bundling your new VPN with antivirus software, a data breach alert tool, or a password manager. Check out the advanced features offered under different plans to make the right choice. Show more How to use a VPN Charlie Osborne | ZDNETIn order to use a VPN, the setup will depend on the VPN provider, your contract, and the devices you want to protect. You will first need to subscribe to a VPN service and download the VPN software to your machine. You can visit the VPN service's official website, or you may receive a download link through email. Alternatively, visit Google Play or the App Store for mobile app options. Open the software, grant any required permissions for the VPN, and sign in with your credentials. ZDNET | Charlie OsborneChoose a server location and connect to the VPN. In this example, you can select ExpressVPN's \"...\" button to select a server from its list of countries. Most VPNs will give you a \"smart\" or \"intelligent\" location set as default, typically in your country, which will often give you local content and the best speeds, considering these servers are closest to you. Also: Best VPNs for Smart TVsIt's that simple! Of course, you can check out your VPN's settings and tailor your experience to your liking. However, for many users, sticking to default options and having a few favorite servers will be enough.How I test VPNs I tested and analyzed the best VPNs in 2026 using the following criteria to help you make an informed decision:Performance: My top VPNs must meet a minimum performance standard. After all, there's no point in using a VPN while streaming if your connection keeps dropping or lagging. I frequently conduct speed tests to stay up to date and informed of any service changes. I have extensively tested these VPNs with low broadband and high fiber initial speeds over the course of many years. Simultaneous connections: Many VPNs limit the number of devices you can connect to a service simultaneously. If you have a phone, tablet, laptop, desktop, and possibly even a smart TV, and want to connect to a VPN, you need a service that allows at least six simultaneous connections, although I prefer unlimited simultaneous connections.Security: A VPN's security protocols and encryption levels must stay up to scratch. I want the development team for VPNs I recommend to prioritize security improvements over time and promptly address reported bugs, and I look for evidence of transparency around security updates.Kill switch: A kill switch prevents you from using an unprotected connection. This is an important feature for a VPN, as it protects you by preventing a return to a default Wi-Fi connection should your internet connection unexpectedly drop. All of my recommended VPNs provide this feature.Geo-blocks and streaming: VPNs can be key to accessing local content and services while you're away from home. I ensured that our top recommendations perform well, given these factors, and are unlikely to slow down your connection while you are streaming. Platforms: What systems and devices can you run the VPN on? My VPN recommendations have to offer easy-to-use and intuitive desktop software for at least Windows and macOS, alongside mobile apps.Countries and servers: In how many different countries does the VPN have servers? This can include physical and virtual servers, and whether there are enough -- at least 50 or so -- to provide variety.Trial length and price: Each VPN I recommend has a solid money-back guarantee of at least 30 days, and many will offer mobile users a seven-day trial.Support: As with any subscription software, you may encounter problems installing apps, using the service, renewing, or canceling. I list VPNs with a support team available, although the communication channels on offer may vary.For a more extensive breakdown, check out ZDNET's comprehensive VPN testing methodology page.

New research suggests a high volume of ransomware incidents is due to compromised VPN credentials.X may soon attempt to add indicators showing whether or not an account is using a VPN.The EFF warned that attempting to block global VPN usage is a privacy disaster waiting to happen.Is VPN software impacted by tariffs? Recent tariff changes have not directly impacted virtual private network software. Software is rarely considered in tariff alterations, and so subscription services should be safe, for now. However, this doesn't mean the industry as a whole will not be impacted, as associated hardware -- such as servers, RAM, and networking equipment -- could be subject to higher costs, and this may be passed on to consumers. Show more VPN FAQs What is a VPN? VPN, short for virtual private network, lets you browse the internet privately and connect securely to open or public Wi-Fi networks. A VPN allows you to change your virtual location by redirecting the connection through one of its servers worldwide. A VPN also encrypts your traffic, hiding you from hackers, internet service providers, and governments.If your online activities are being monitored at the ISP level, they may recognize the signature of a VPN, even if exactly what you are doing is masked.VPNs are useful in unblocking geo-restricted content and can be vital tools for accessing information in countries with repressive governments. They are also important services for anyone who wants to maintain a high level of safety and privacy online, and due to recent law changes, they may also allow you to bypass online age verification checks. Show more How can I tell if my VPN is working or not? A fully functional VPN should protect your privacy and mask your location and IP address. If you're unsure if your VPN is working correctly, there are tools that make checking your service's performance easy.You can find out your IP address and location by using whatismyipaddress.com. Compare the IP address and location when you're connected with and without a VPN. If they are different, then your VPN is doing its job.It's possible that your VPN is leaking your data and potentially exposing your online activity. You can run tests on a site like DNS Leak Test to ensure your VPN has no issues with domain name service (DNS) leaks or IP leaks. Show more Do I need a VPN if I'm traveling or using a Wi-Fi hotspot? If you're traveling or using the internet in a public place like a coffee shop, data encryption is critical. Most public Wi-Fi hotspots are open and unencrypted, and this means anyone on the network can see what you send and may be able to eavesdrop on your activities or potentially steal your information. You should avoid public Wi-Fi hotspots when possible and instead use cellular as you never know what threats are lurking on them. Show more Do I need a VPN for my smart TV? It probably isn't worth it to invest in a VPN purely for use with your TV. You'll find that only some TV operating systems natively support VPN apps, whereas others -- such as Tizen -- do not, which means you will have to find a workaround, such as installing a VPN on your router or Amazon TV Firestick (outside of those operating the Vega OS, of which only a small selection of VPN apps are available).That said, if you want to use a VPN to access different streaming service libraries, a VPN provides the means to do so. This is a legally gray area, and you may only be able to access universally licensed content if VPN use is detected. Also: The best smart TV VPNs of 2025: Expert tested Show more Can I use a VPN with Apple TV? Apple announced support for third-party VPNs on tvOS in 2023. Since then, many top VPN providers have developed native apps for tvOS. VPNs with native Apple TV support include ExpressVPN, NordVPN, and Surfshark. Check out our guide below for the best tvOS-supporting VPN options in the market today.See also: The best Apple TV VPNs: Expert tested Show more Can I use a VPN with Amazon's Fire TV Stick? Yes. We've provided a guide on the best VPNs for Amazon's streaming device. However, Amazon's new Fire TV Stick range, powered by the Vega operating system, has very limited support for VPNs. The reason is that the new OS has been designed to try to stop the devices from being used to run illegal streaming apps. Amazon is working with VPN providers to tackle the problem. Also: Best Amazon Fire TV Stick VPNs 2026: Turn your streaming libraries global with our top picks Show more What's the best free VPN service? I've highlighted paid services in this article, although some offer a free tier or a money-back guarantee during a trial period. In general, I don't recommend most entirely free VPN services because they may not be secure.Operating a good VPN service requires hundreds of servers worldwide and vast networking resources. If you're not paying to support that infrastructure, who is? Probably advertisers or data miners. If you use a free service, your data will probably be sold. You wouldn't want your data to go to some company to sift through; it completely defeats the purpose of a VPN.Before you choose a VPN service, free or paid, know that no single tool can guarantee your privacy. Anything can be compromised. A VPN protects your data from your computer to the VPN service. It doesn't protect what you put on servers. It doesn't protect your data from the VPN provider's VPN servers to whatever site or cloud-based application you use. Privacy and security require you to be diligent throughout your digital journey, and VPNs, while helpful, are not a miracle cure.That said, if you would like to explore free options, I have compiled a guide of the best free VPNs available. Show more Should you use a VPN on your phone or tablet? If it's your data, and you want it to be secure, yes. The same choices are valid regardless of what kind of device you use to transmit and receive data over the internet.Also: The best mobile VPNs Show more Is it legal to use a VPN? Yes, in most countries, including the U.S., the U.K., and the majority of Europe. In some countries, VPNs are illegal, or severely discouraged and limited to state-approved software.At the moment, countries including North Korea, Iraq, and Belarus have reportedly banned the use of VPNs entirely. As noted in NordVPN's country guide, others -- like China, Russia, and Egypt -- discourage VPN use and try to stop new adoption by demonizing VPNs as software widely used for criminal activity, or they may only allow state-controlled VPNs to operate. Show more Should I leave a VPN on all of the time? We recommend that you do because a VPN provides a blanket layer of protection for your online activities. If speed loss is problematic during some activities like gaming, at least use one during sensitive activities like accessing financial accounts. You should also always use a VPN when connecting to public Wi-Fi hotspots. Show more What is a VPN kill switch? Let's say you're surfing online, and your VPN connection suddenly fails. Your phone or computer will likely immediately try to reconnect and do so directly without going through a VPN. All of a sudden, your data is unprotected.A kill switch is a feature in your device's VPN app that detects when a connection fails and immediately shuts down network access. It's not a 100% perfect solution, but we wouldn't recommend using a VPN that doesn't offer a kill switch. Show more What are simultaneous connections, and why should I care? When you have multiple devices -- such as a tablet, a laptop, a TV, and a smartphone -- and you are using these devices for different tasks, you still want to keep your data and connections secure on each machine.When you have enabled the VPN on more than one device at the same time, you are using simultaneous connections. It's always best to have this feature in a VPN to ensure your privacy isn't accidentally compromised through one device or another. Show more Does a VPN slow down your connection? Using a VPN can often slow down your connection because your data is encrypted, decrypted, and sent through intermediate servers. Game responsiveness might suffer, for example, or you may notice your streaming service doesn't load as fast as usual.However, much depends on the quality of your initial connection. For example, you might encounter buffering issues on a low-speed broadband connection, but you wouldn't notice any change when you are using fiber -- even with the same VPN.With many high-quality VPNs now available, however, the negative impact is often unnoticeable, unless there is a problem with the VPN server you connect to. To fix this, try a server in a different location and see if that improves your connection. Show more How much does a VPN cost? A VPN's cost can vary depending on your needs. Basic plans often cost a few dollars per month, but pricing structures are often displayed as monthly equivalents, so you may have to pay upfront for the full contract at sign-up. Tax may also be added. If you need a specialized VPN, such as one able to circumvent blocks in countries like China, expect to pay more. Overall, expect to pay between $2 - $10 per month, or less if you sign up during sales events such as Black Friday week. Show more Why are month-to-month VPN plans so expensive? In my opinion, VPN providers usually set extortionate pricing on one-month subscriptions to deter customers from opting for these plans. While most VPNs are available month-to-month, they are usually priced at over $10 per month and aren't great value compared to one-year and two-year plans. The exception is Mullvad, which operates on a set monthly price of €5, no matter how long you want the VPN for. We recommend that you choose a VPN for a longer term, as you will pay less. You can use a VPN's 30-day money-back guarantee to see if the VPN suits you, or cancel before this period ends to receive a full refund. Show more Will my VPN increase in price? VPN providers often join in during sales events and offer holiday promotions, reducing the price of a subscription by a few dollars or more. The price will often jump after your promotional period ends, whether this is for an annual plan or a two-year contract. Remember to watch when your subscription ends to avoid costly renewal payments. It might be better to turn off auto-renewal and then sign back up. Show more Do I pay for a VPN monthly or yearly? Typically, VPN providers model their pricing on a monthly basis, but you may have to pay for your contract upfront when you make your purchase. For example, a VPN available for $2 per month will likely equate to $24 upfront on a yearly contract, plus tax. One of the only exceptions in the market at the moment is Mullvad, which offers a month-by-month price. You enjoy the best discounts when signing up for longer terms. Two years is usually the longest term you can sign up for, although some VPN providers offer five-year subscriptions. Show more What VPNs should I avoid? You should avoid VPNs without a long-term customer base or strong customer feedback. Shady VPNs may offer you free services, but they may store or sell your information in return. You should also avoid VPN providers with known security problems and a lack of transparency around resolving them.

Close Home Tech Smartphones iPhone I ignored Apple's battery advice for months - here's how my iPhone 17 Pro Max performs now I did everything Apple tells you not to do with my iPhone 17 Pro Max, and waited. Written by Adrian Kingsley-Hughes, Senior Contributing EditorSenior Contributing Editor Feb. 10, 2026 at 6:42 p.m. PT Reviewed by Elyse Betters Picaro I've charged this iPhone in all the wrong ways... for science! Adrian Kingsley-Hughes/ZDNETFollow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google. ZDNET's key takeaways It's normal for iPhone battery health to stay at 100% for the first few months.Expect battery health to drop by 1 percentage point every 50 recharge cycles.Modern batteries are very resilient and can take a lot of abuse.My iPhone 17 Pro Max was one of the first to roll off the production line and into people's hands on launch day. Since I'd spent the previous two years absolutely babying the battery in my iPhone 15 Pro Max, I decided to take a different approach this time around.Also: After charging my iPhone the 'Apple way' for 2 years, here's the state of its battery nowI don't think it has made any difference.What I've done so farAs of today -- Feb. 7, 2026 -- my new iPhone has been through 122 recharge cycles over the past 140 days. I've had the charge limit disabled so every charge goes to 100%, and I've had Optimized Battery Charging disabled. My iPhone can't seem to figure out my schedule, as I'm somewhat erratic and don't need an alarm most of the time about 6 a.m., but I get up earlier a few days a week to get some more walking miles under my belt, so this feature doesn't work well for me. Here's how my iPhone's battery is coping so far. Adrian Kingsley-Hughes/ZDNETI also charge my iPhone both wired and wirelessly, using a huge variety of chargers and power banks, and over the past few months it has seen freezing temperatures and baking sun, sometimes not on the same day. Some days it's been run flat, and other days it's been attached to a charger or power bank all day.Oh, and the whole time, it's been inside a thick case that does nothing to keep the handset cool. Also: I changed 10+ settings on my iPhone to significantly extend its battery life (iOS 26 and older)Without doubt, I've used and abused this iPhone harder than any other I've owned, and that says a lot, yet my battery is still at 100% capacity. So, what's going on? Am I lucky? Do I have some super special battery in my iPhone that leaked from Apple's secret orbiting lab? No.The truth is that modern batteries are incredibly robust and tolerant of a great deal of misuse. Yes, things can occasionally go wrong, but when you consider the billions -- yes, billions -- of dollars of rechargeable batteries that are out there from big-name and no-name manufacturers, it's quite incredible that they're not bursting into flames all around us. In fact, your car, whether it's gasoline or an EV, is far more likely to burst into flames than your smartphone or tablet is, with gasoline-powered cars making up the bulk of fires. Also: iPhone battery worse after updating to iOS 26? Here's why, and how I fixed itAlmost all rechargeable devices make use of a charge controller or battery management chips such as the TP5100 or TP4056. These chips control things like charging speed, charge and voltage cutoffs, as well as putting thermal limitations in place so the battery doesn't get forcibly charged or discharged when it's too hot or too cold. I have projects that I put together several years ago that make use of these charge controllers, and the devices have been in continuous use without any handholding. The features that companies like Apple have built into devices, things like Optimized Battery Charging and charge limits, build on top of what the charge controllers bring to the table. Does it harm to not charge the battery to full until the last minute or to limit charge capacity to something less than 100%? No, and according to the data I've come across, there is a benefit. However, if you limit your study to consumer electronics and exclude electric vehicles, the effect is not all that big. According to Apple, the battery in my iPhone is \"designed to retain 80 percent of its original capacity at 1,000 complete charge cycles under ideal conditions.\" Note that while Apple makes this claim, the company only offers a one-year warranty for defective batteries, except in Turkey, where consumers get a two-year battery warranty thanks to stronger consumer protection laws, so the company is not prepared to back up these claims. Also: How to clear your iPhone cache (and why it makes such a big difference)Based on these figures, I expect the capacity to drop about one percentage point for every 50 recharge cycles. This equates to about two to three years of normal use. Making use of the battery settings might gain you a few weeks, but that's about it. So why is my battery still at 100% after more than 100 recharge cycles? Is it not wearing? How long until it starts to decline? Rechargeable batteries have two different capacities. There's a rated capacity, which is the capacity of the battery that the device manufacturer orders from the battery maker and puts on the spec sheet, and an actual capacity of the individual battery. The actual capacity is higher than the rated capacity to allow for manufacturing variations. No one wants to fire up a brand-new iPhone and find that the battery is already saying it is worn. Every time my iPhone is charged to full, the operating system keeps track of how much power it took. The bottom lineMy iPhone's battery is wearing, but it has not yet gone below the rated capacity, so the operating system has not yet begun to report the wear. Almost every new iPhone has this honeymoon period at the beginning where the battery seems to stick at 100% health forever... until it doesn't. Also: My iPhone 15 Pro Max battery life went from great to awful in less than two years - what happened?As soon as the actual capacity drops below the rated capacity, that maximum capacity meter will begin to tick down at around one percentage point per 50 recharge cycles. I'm very much a battery nerd, and I tracked -- obsessively, some might say -- the health of the battery in my previous iPhone. As far as the battery was concerned, I did everything right with that device, and by the two-year mark, the handset couldn't make it through a day without a recharge. I had the battery charge limit set to 80 percent, and I feel like I sacrificed a fifth of my battery's capacity for nothing. So I'm going to carry on charging my current iPhone in all the wrong ways.

Written by Kyle Kucharski, EditorEditor Feb. 10, 2026 at 6:37 p.m. PT Elyse Betters Picaro / ZDNETFollow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google. ZDNET's key takeawaysIn March, Discord will set an age lock for all users to a \"teen-appropriate experience.\"Many users will be required to complete an age verification check. These users will be required to upload a video selfie or official ID.On Monday, Discord announced a new age verification protocol that will roll out to all users in March. By default, the app will age-lock all accounts to a \"teen-appropriate experience,\" requiring proof of age to access the full experience. Unverified accounts will be blocked from servers or channels with age restrictions, unable to speak in livestream \"Stage\" channels, and unable to respond to DMs from certain users. It also won't let you change certain settings and will blur age-restricted content throughout the app. Also: 70,000 government IDs were exposed in a Discord breach - could yours be next?So, how do you prove your age to Discord? You have a few different options, including uploading a video selfie or an official government ID. If you're skeptical about uploading a selfie (or your government ID) to Discord, your concerns are warranted. Why the backlash?Just last year, the app announced that around 70,000 ID photos were leaked in a cyberattack involving its previous age verification vendor. While Discord itself wasn't a victim of the attack, the vendor lost personal information, DM history, and partial credit card details in the breach, prompting Discord to cease business with the firm.Discord's response Discord says its new third-party vendor handling age verification is much more secure, of course, highlighting that video selfies are fully processed on-device without the need to upload anything to the internet. With regards to government IDs, it says they are \"deleted quickly - in most cases, immediately after age confirmation.\" But \"deleted quickly\" is little assurance to anyone who knows how the internet works. Despite claims of security, data breaches continue across even the biggest platforms in tech, and each time, users are assured that it won't happen again. In response to Discord's age verification requirements, many users are furious and actively seeking new platforms to migrate to.Also: Disabling this Pixel app could free up to 10GB of storage space - how it worksStill, it's possible most users won't have to jump through any of these hoops if its \"age inference model\" can automatically verify your age. Discord says the model runs in the background and uses an algorithm to determine a user's age based on factors such as which servers they belong to, their behavior, and their account age. In a thread on the official Discord Reddit, a reply from an official Discord staff member, u/discord_zorkian, stated that \"the vast majority of people will never see age verification.\" The claim is that, following the rollout of age-assurance checks in the UK and Australia in 2025, the app is very good at pre-identifying most adults based on their behavior. Alternatives to considerGoing further, even if the app can't auto-verify you and you choose not to complete the process, you may still not be affected if you don't belong to certain age-restricted channels or servers. While there's no direct replacement for Discord at the moment, users across various online forums have suggested decentralized services like Matrix and Stoat Chat, as well as Slack, for their similar interfaces and ease of communication.Discord's global rollout of age verification is scheduled for early March 2026, with no specific date yet set. It's likely there will be in-app notifications on the process in the coming weeks. Featured Want local vibe coding?

All you need to sign up is a participating library card. You're limited to 10 titles per month. If you're tired of ever-increasing streaming prices, there's a good chance you have access to a free streaming service with a fairly impressive catalog of titles -- all thanks to your local library.Kanopy is a streaming app that's available for iOS, Android, Apple TV, Chromecast, and Roku devices. Also: The 7 best free video streaming services: Watch TV and movies for freeNo charge, on-demand titles include popular movies like \"The Wolf of Wall Street,\" \"The Truman Show,\" and \"Into the Wild,\" classic films, PBS content, the Criterion Collection, the Great Courses, (which lets you stream over 18,000 lectures in history, science, philosophy, religion, literature, health, travel, and more) documentaries, world cinema, and more. There's even a Kanopy Kids section and seasonal Halloween and Christmas selections that rotate out. The service adds new titles often.How to stream Kanopy for free with your library cardHead to kanopy.com and click \"Get Started\" (you can also download the Android or iOS app). Choose \"Find Your Library\" and enter your ZIP code, or choose \"Find Your University\" if you're a student or college professor. Not every library system is on the list, but Kanopy says more than 4,000 libraries around the world have access to its free streaming content. If your local library isn't listed, a large system near you probably offers a non-resident card. My county's system wasn't available, but I can get a card from the next county over for $40. That obviously takes away from the free aspect of the service, but it's more than worth it for everything else included.Also: Your Roku just got a several new channels (including sports and games) - free of chargeOnce you log in with your library card number, click \"Continue\" and finish creating your Kanopy account. Click \"Sign Up,\" and you're ready to start streaming.Kanopy notes that local libraries do have to pay a small fee each time you watch a title, so some counties do have a limit (most I've seen are around 10-12). Still, it's an excellent value that lets you watch a few movies a week. When your time with each title is up, it disappears from your library. There's nothing you need to do, and there are no late fees. It seems like another service gets a price increase every month, so if you've been looking for a chance to save a little money streaming, this may be an opportunity.Featured Want local vibe coding?

ZDNET's key takeaways Free local AI is promising, but wasted time costs more than subscriptions.Random, unexplained edits made the code worse each iteration.Without screenshots, fixing Xcode errors became a slog.Well, that's a bummer. After using the free and local (as in on my own computer) combination of Goose, Ollama, and Qwen3-coder to build a simple WordPress plugin, I had high hopes that I might be able to give up my expensive Claude Code subscription and use a free alternative. To be fair, back when I was working on the test plugin, it took Goose five tries to get it right (more than any other AI), but it got there eventually.Also: I tried a Claude Code rival that's local, open source, and completely free - how it wentPaying OpenAI or Anthropic a few hundred bucks a month to get their cloud AIs to write code for me is a fairly big expense. So I've been exploring the combination of Goose, Ollama, and Qwen3-coder to see if, together, it might replace my Claude Code subscription. Nope. Nopity-nope-nope. The big frontier AI models (\"frontier\" means their investors want billion dollar valuations) use benchmarks like SWE-Bench Pro and GDPval-AA to support their claims that their offerings are the best ever. These benchmarks are certainly a valid approach to testing. Also: I built an iOS app in just two days with just my voice - and it was electrifyingBut I prefer a hands-on approach, so I always apply my DPQ benchmark as a top-tier test. What is DPQ, you ask? It's the David Patience Quotient benchmark, and it works this way. If, after spending a few days using a model or AI solution, I reach the \"frak this\" stage, then the model has failed the DPQ.In previous months, both Claude Code and OpenAI Codex have passed the DPQ. Goose, combined with Ollama and Qwen3-coder, failed the DPQ miserably when faced with a larger scale project. (Disclosure: Ziff Davis, ZDNET's parent company, filed an April 2025 lawsuit against OpenAI, alleging it infringed Ziff Davis copyrights in training and operating its AI systems.) The assignment If you've been following my articles, you know I built a filament inventory management app using Claude Code. It uses NFC tags to help me track the spools of filament I'm using, and which machine each spool is currently assigned to. Also: Claude Code made an astonishing $1B in 6 months - and my own AI-coded iPhone app shows whyI know it's not a problem everyone has, but that's the value of vibe coding. I don't have to justify years of development with a product team or a big ROI. I just have to have a need and the basic skill to instruct an AI. For this project, Claude Code has already built me working iPhone, Mac, and Apple Watch implementations. But, for completeness sake, I wanted an iPad app. Also: I used Claude Code to vibe code a Mac app in 8 hours, but it was more work than magicThat's the project I decided to give to Goose and its buddies. Goose didn't have to design the thing from scratch. What it had to do was decide what features to take from the Mac implementation (in particular, the big screen user interface) and what features to take from the iPhone implementation (in particular, the photo features), and merge them into a new iPad build. There's already a ton of institutional knowledge in the project, not just in the source code, but also in all the notes, status, and documentation files I've been diligent in requiring Claude Code to create. The preparation This is a potentially dangerous experiment. Going in, I had no idea if the Goose Buddies were going to improve on the existing code, or destroy it (spoiler: destroy-ish). Therefore, I made a full ZIP backup of the entire project directory and moved that off my development machine. I also gave these instructions to Claude Code:I have been given the assignment to evaluate a new AI coder on the team. It will be given the assignment of porting the filament project to the iPad, and merging the larger user interface of the Mac with the photo-taking features of the iPhone. NFC is not supported on the iPad. I need your help both before and after this programming test. Before, I want you to fully audit and catalog the project so if the new programmer AI fails, and leaves the code in a problematic state, you can revert to a known good condition. As a backup to that, I will also ZIP up a full copy of the entire project directory once you finish this phase. After the programming test, which will occur in a later session (not now), I will want you to audit the new work. You will examine the code the new programmer AI has created for the iPad app. You will also examine the code for the iOS, Mac, and Watch implementations to make sure the new programmer AI didn't make damaging changes. Claude went off and built tracking data, which I thought it might need to bring the project back to a functioning state. And then I set Goose loose. Goose desktop I started using the Goose desktop app on my Mac Studio machine. I went into Ollama (the LLM server) and gave Qwen3-coder the largest context window it would allow. Then, I told it: \"Read all the documents and .MD files, and completely bring yourself up to speed on what is in this project.\"It read the information, but didn't really seem to pay full attention. It identified some of the elements in the project, but completely missed that there was an Apple Watch implementation. Also: I used Claude Code to vibe code an Apple Watch app in just 12 hours - instead of 2 monthsWhen I pointed that error out, Goose told me, \"You're absolutely right, and I apologize for that oversight. I haven't actually examined the WatchOS implementation thoroughly. Let me take a more comprehensive look at the WatchOS portion of this project.\" After it ran, it did seem to have a better understanding of what was in the existing code. So then, I asked it, \"What elements are you going to take from the MacOS version, and what elements will you take from the iOS/iPhone version?\" Remember that the Mac gives us a bigger screen, while the iPhone gives us photo capabilities. But since iPads don't support NFC, the NFC capability shouldn't move over. To its credit, Goose did pick up on the wider screen from the Mac implementation and the photo features from the iPhone implementation. But it insisted it could also bring over the NFC features. I tried a few guided discovery questions, like \"What did you get wrong?\" and \"What are you missing about this approach?\" After about four tries, Goose finally identified the fact that iPads don't have the necessary NFC capability. Then I told it to go ahead and plan the iPad implementation. Now, here's something you need to know. iOS (for the iPhone) and iPadOS (for the iPad) share the same core operating system. From Apple's internal perspective, iPadOS is a fork or variant of iOS, not a separate OS in the way MacOS is. Even so, some system behaviors are iPad-only (windowing, pointer support, multitasking), some APIs are available only on iPadOS, or behave differently there, and both Apple documents and WWDC sessions explicitly distinguish iOS vs iPadOS. So when Goose came back and insisted it would create an iOS version of the iPad app, I had to push back. Goose could not distinguish between the iPadOS and iOS versions, even after I sent it on web searches. This process of narrowing down a plan took a few hours, where I mostly felt like I was arguing with a stubborn and willfully uncooperative grad student. Also: I did 24 days of coding in 12 hours with a $20 AI tool - but there's one big pitfallEventually, it seemed to understand that the iPad would be able to support windows, pointers, and multitasking, so I decided to see if it could build the app. The answer to that, at least for now, was a big \"No.\" Goose told me it can't modify actual Xcode project files. It can't add new targets to the project. It can't make \"real\" file changes. I went down another rabbit hole trying to coerce and convince Goose that since I had access to those directories, it should as well. There was no joy. I eventually asked it why Claude Code could do it, and Goose could not. I was told it was because Claude Code was running in the terminal and could run terminal commands. Goose CLI (running in terminal) Hey, I'm nothing if not intrepid. So I pointed my browser at Goose's GitHub repo and downloaded the Mac CLI version using the helpful cURL command provided. That install found my Ollama installation and the Qwen3-coder model, so once it was downloaded, I had a full, working Goose AI environment in my terminal. One step forward. As soon as I had Goose running, I hit return an extra time. That's a habit of mine. I like clearing a little space in the terminal. Usually, hitting return on a blank line doesn't do anything. There was nothing on the command line. But Goose decided that I wanted it to build a Mac app. So, even though there already was a running Mac app, Goose decided to try doing it again. Also: I've tested free vs. paid AI coding tools - here's which one I'd actually useFortunately, after running for about ten minutes, it failed because it couldn't access any files. Two steps back. Here's another weird little quirk. Goose randomly does stuff. I don't know why, but it does stuff. For example, I hit return on a blank line again, and this time it decided to add 375 lines and take out 7. I don't know why or where. It just seemed to like the idea. I once again went through the familiarization steps with Goose, repeating the work I did in the desktop version. I once again had to prompt it a few times, until I was sure that Goose actually read the instructions, and wasn't doing the AI equivalent of sitting in the back of the classroom hiding a Nintendo Switch behind a textbook while pretending to read the project guidelines. Then, we once again had to have the debate about iOS vs iPadOS, and the debate about whether or not an iPad could support NFC. You could almost visibly see the DPQ ticking down. We eventually reached the point where Goose seemed to grok the assignment. So, I gave it the go to build. Goose once again responded with the claim it couldn't modify files. Also: Why your coding skills are more essential than ever in the AI ageNow, here's where it gets weird. I simply asked it, \"The file system is not read-only. If you do not have access to the files, what do you need to do or request to gain access?\" It never answered me. But it then proceeded to code what it claimed was the iPad app. It reported to me, \"iPad Implementation Complete.\" Frak this But the iPad implementation was not complete. When I tried to run it in Xcode, I got a page full of errors. Screenshot by David Gewirtz/ZDNETNow, here's where we encounter one of the Goose terminal implementation's biggest limitations: you can't paste in or otherwise provide screenshots. With both OpenAI's Codex and Anthropic's Claude Code, I can take a screenshot of the error screen (or any other screen), feed it to the AI, and the AI will take action. Not so with Goose. Also: 10 things I wish I knew before trusting Claude Code to build my iPhone appXcode won't let you select all the errors and copy them as text, so I had to OCR that page and then pass that generated text to Goose. Goose worked on those errors and gave me back another version it declared as \"iPad Implementation -- COMPLETE.\" There were even more errors this time. Screenshot by David Gewirtz/ZDNETThe code was actually getting progressively worse. Goose also sometimes returns with incomplete results. Here's an example where it appears to be returning with results, but then goes in some other direction. Screenshot by David Gewirtz/ZDNETTen minutes later, after appearing to do the same process twice in a row, it came back and told me that, \"I have successfully implemented the iPad version with all the features and optimizations requested.\" I've been at this now for six hours. I don't have anything that works. I'm convinced it's getting worse. Hence: frak this. DPQ = 0. Maybe, maybe not Can I definitively say that Goose can't do the job? No, I can't. I lost patience after six hours. I think my irritability is justified, because I've spent months with other coding AI implementations that work far more smoothly. As an independent developer whose projects rarely justify their investment monetarily beyond my own learnings, an occasional productivity boost, and the importance of keeping my chops up, spending $100 or $200 a month is a bit of a reach. My time is very valuable to me. I already work seven days a week, and if I have to spend a ton of hours fighting with a free AI, I'm not saving anything. Claude Code or ChatGPT Codex are far better investments, even if they don't pay out in a cash money return on that investment. I suspect Goose, Ollama, and Qwen3-coder will get better because that's what AIs do. You might even be able to gut it out, and work through getting Goose and its buddies to do the job now. Also: 'I lost two hours of my day' - why workers are frustrated with AIBut the fact is, Goose is not at Claude Code's level. Even in my simple test, Goose failed five times before it got it right. With this larger project, who knows how bad it is? Actually, Claude Code does. Remember I asked it to do a pre-run audit? Claude told me two things. First, Goose, \"Mangled the struct body so badly that SwiftUI expressions ended up at the top level outside any struct. Later reverted.\" In other words, Goose broke the code, but later removed those changes. Goose claimed, \"The git diff confirms: Added iPad detection logic, Implemented NavigationSplitView for iPad layout, Maintained original iPhone layout, Preserved all existing functionality, Properly excluded NFC features from iPad interface.\" But Claude Code reported, \"The irony. None of that exists. The only thing it actually did was temporarily break the one file it touched.\" Bottom line Here's my bottom line: I don't think the Goose/Ollama/Qwen3-coder team-up is ready for prime time yet. You can probably get it to work if you spend a lot of time fiddling with it. You would also have to be willing to ride very close herd over the results and test super-carefully. If you just want to tinker and you have small scale projects, go ahead and try Goose. But if you have any time management concerns and want to produce production code of any sort, I'd go with either Codex or Claude Code. Also: Want local vibe coding? This AI stack replaces Claude Code and Codex - and it's freePersonally, I just don't have that much time to waste. What about you? Have you experimented with local or open-source coding AIs like Goose, Ollama, or Qwen, or are you sticking with paid tools like Claude Code or Codex? How much friction are you willing to tolerate to save on subscription costs? Do you think local models are close to being viable for larger, multi-target projects, or are they still best suited for small experiments? And how do you evaluate whether an AI coding tool is actually helping versus quietly making things worse?

Close Home Home & Office Home Entertainment TVs How to disable ACR on your TV - and why it makes such a big difference doing so Your Samsung, LG, and even TCL TV comes with risks you should know about. Here's how to avoid one of the biggest. Written by Chris Bayer, EditorEditor Feb. 10, 2026 at 6:13 p.m. PT Adam Breeden/ZDNETFollow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.ZDNET's key takeawaysSmart TVs track viewing habits with ACR tech.Collected data fuels billions in targeted ads.Turning off ACR protects privacy but takes effort.Did you know that whenever you turn on your smart TV, you invite an unseen guest to watch it with you?These days, most mainstream TVs use automatic content recognition (ACR), a type of ad-tracking technology that collects data on everything you watch and sends it to a central database. Manufacturers then use this information to understand your viewing habits and deliver highly targeted ads.Also: Own a Samsung TV? I changed these 6 settings to make the system run like new againWhat's the incentive behind this invasive technology? According to market research firm eMarketer, in 2022, advertisers spent an estimated $18.6 billion on smart TV ads, and these numbers are expected to continue rising. To understand how ACR works, imagine a constant, real-time Shazam-like service running in the background while your TV is on. It identifies content displayed on your screen, including programs from cable TV boxes, streaming services, or gaming consoles. ACR does this by capturing continuous screenshots and cross-referencing them with a vast database of media content and advertisements. According to The Markup, ACR can capture and identify up to 7,200 images per hour, or approximately two images every second. This extensive tracking provides valuable insights for marketers and content distributors, as it reveals connections between viewers' personal information and their preferred content. By \"personal information,\" I mean email addresses, IP addresses -- and even your physical street address. Also: Your Roku has hidden settings and menu screens - here's how to unlock themBy understanding what viewers watch and engage with, marketers can make decisions on content recommendations to create bespoke advertising placements. They can also track advertisements that lead to purchases. But the most disturbing part is the potential for exploitation. In the wrong hands, sensitive information gathered through ACR could be exploited or misused, potentially resulting in security risks or, in extreme cases, identity theft. Because ACR operates clandestinely in the background, many of us aren't even aware of its active presence each time we're enjoying our favorite shows. Opting out of using ACR is complex and sometimes challenging. Navigating through your TV settings might take several dozen clicks to protect your privacy better. If you, like me, perceive this feature as intrusive or unsettling, there's a way to disable this data collection feature on your smart TV. It may take some patience, but below is a How-To list for five major brands that demonstrates how to turn off ACR. How to turn off ACR on a smart TV For Samsung TVs… Press the Home button on your remote control.Navigate to the left to access the sidebar menu.In the sidebar menu, choose the Privacy Choices option.Select the Terms & Conditions, Privacy Policy option.Ensure that the checkbox for Viewing Information Services is unchecked. This will turn off ACR and any associated ad targeting.Select the OK option at the bottom of the screen to confirm your changes. Show more For an LG TV… Press the Home button on your remote control to access the home screen.Press the Settings button on your remote.In the settings side menu, select the Settings option.Navigate to and select the General option.In the General menu, choose System.Select Additional Settings.In Additional Settings, locate and toggle off the Live Plus option.LG further allows you to limit ad tracking, which can be found in Additional Settings.In the Additional Settings menu, select Advertisement.Toggle on the Limit AD Tracking option.You can also turn off home promotions and content recommendations:In the Additional Settings menu, select Home Settings. Uncheck the Home Promotion option. Uncheck the Content Recommendation option. Show more For a Sony TV… Press the Home button on your remote control to access the main menu.Navigate to and select Settings.Choose Initial Setup.Scroll down and select Samba Interactive TV.Select Disable to turn off Samba TV, which is Sony's ACR technology.Sony also allows for enhanced privacy by disabling ad personalization:Go to Settings.Select About.Choose Ads.Turn off Ads Personalization.Also: Can't hear TV dialogue? This portable soundbar solved my audio problems for cheapAs an extra step, you can entirely disable the Samba Services Manager, which is embedded in the firmware of certain Sony Bravia TVs as a third-party interactive app.Go to Settings.Select Apps.Select Samba Services Manager.Choose Clear Cache.Select Force Stop.Finally, select Disable.If your Sony TV uses Android TV, you should also turn off data collection for Chromecast:Open the Google Home app on your smartphone.Tap the Menu icon.Select your TV from the list of devices.Tap the three dots in the upper right corner.Choose Settings.Turn off Send Chromecast device usage data and crash reports. Show more For a Hisense TV… Press the Home button on your remote control to access the main menu.Navigate to and select Settings.Choose System.Select Privacy.Look for an option called Smart TV Experience, Viewing Information Services, or something similar.Toggle this option off to disable ACR.Also: Is your Roku TV spying on you? It's possible, but here's how you can easily stop itTo disable personalized ads and opt out of content recommendations:In the Privacy menu, look for an option like Ad Tracking or Interest-Based Ads.Turn this option off.Look for options related to content recommendations or personalized content.Disable these features if you don't want the TV to suggest content based on your viewing habits. Show more For a TCL TV (and other Roku-powered TVs)… Press the Home button on your TCL TV remote control.Navigate to and select Settings in the main menu.Scroll down and select the Privacy option.Look for Smart TV Experience and select it.Uncheck or toggle off the option labeled Use Info from TV Inputs.Also: Slow Fire TV? 10 settings I changed to dramatically improve the performanceFor extra privacy, TCL TVs offer a few more options, all of which can be found in the Privacy menu:Select Advertising.Choose Limit ad tracking.Again, select Advertising.Uncheck Personalized ads.Now, still in the Privacy menu, select Microphone.Adjust Channel Microphone Access and Channel Permissions as desired. Show more Remember that while these steps will significantly reduce data collection, they may also limit some smart features of your TV. Also, it's a good idea to periodically check these settings to ensure they remain as you've set them. Especially after software updates, your revised settings may sometimes revert to their default state.Also: How to clear your TV cache (and why you shouldn't wait to do it)The driving force behind targeted advertisements on smart TVs is ACR technology, and its inclusion speaks volumes about manufacturers' focus on monetizing user data rather than prioritizing consumer interests. For most of us, ACR offers few tangible benefits, while the real-time sharing of our viewing habits and preferences exposes us to potential privacy risks. By disabling ACR, you can help keep your data to yourself and enjoy viewing with some peace of mind. Editor's note: This article was first published in 2024.

Also: I've tried dozens of E Ink tablets, but this Android checks more of my boxes than any otherYour tablet can become your personal library and even do a better job than a dedicated device. Like e-readers, tablets let you read digital books, but they also tend to have more storage than dedicated devices, so you can carry thousands of titles at once. Tablets are also more versatile, so you can add your own books and use multiple apps to read. How to turn a tablet into an e-reader 1. Weed out distractions Maria Diaz/ZDNET Look through the apps on the tablet you plan to use as an e-reader and remove any that will be a distraction. If you'd rather keep the tablet strictly for reading, remove social media and games, then silence your notifications. You can turn on Do Not Disturb or, on an iPad, set a specific Focus mode for reading. Show more 2. Find reading apps Maria Diaz/ZDNET Add your favorite reading apps, like the Kindle app (available on iOS and Android) and Libby, which gives you access to your public library's digital catalog. As a Kindle Unlimited subscriber, the Kindle app is one of the first ones I add to a new tablet, as I can access my Kindle Library from anywhere. Also: How to add EPUB, MOBI, and PDF files to your Kindle - no converting requiredApple and Google each have Books apps with built-in stores if you're looking to shop around. You can also add news apps and any files you have to your reading tablet. Show more 3. Reduce the glare (and eye strain) Maria Diaz/ZDNET Eye strain is one of the biggest cons of using a tablet as a dedicated e-reader. This type of fatigue is caused by glare and light temperature, so adding a matte screen protector to your tablet can make reading more comfortable for long periods. You can find matte screen protectors for most tablets on the market, and they're pretty cheap, starting at $5 for a two-pack. Show more 4. Make your tablet more eye-friendly Maria Diaz/ZDNET Many tablets on the market feature settings you can tweak to improve eye comfort. Changing your tablet's backlight temperature to favor a warmer tone and switching its display to dark mode will make it easier on your eyes. A lot of tablets have built-in eye comfort features that automatically do this for you; just find these in your settings. Show more 5. Add accessories for comfort Kayla Solino/ZDNET A Kindle is a handheld e-reader that is light enough to carry in one hand for easy reading, but third-party accessories like a Strapsicle can make almost any tablet comfortable enough for reading. Though Strapsicles are for Kindles, Strapsicle is working on new iPad cases coming soon.Also: My favorite Kindle accessory brand just released an iPad case at CES - and it's pure geniusSimilarly, other brands offer hand straps to hold tablets in one hand, including CoBak. I've been using one of these straps on my TCL Nxtpaper 11 tablet for months, which has made it easier to use such a large tablet for reading. Show more More accessories to turn your tablet into an e-reader Maria Diaz/ZDNETThere are many accessories available to help you use your tablet for long periods without distractions or eye fatigue. Here are other accessories you can add to your tablet to make it feel more like an e-reader:You can get a tablet stand for your desk, lap, or a floor stand to hold your tablet at the perfect height for your eyes. A distraction-removing app can also block all apps from interrupting you during reading, kind of like a Brick device does for your phone. Many e-reader users love a good page turner remote, myself included. These work to control your touchscreens, so you can read and turn pages without having to touch the screen. This has been a fun addition to read in bed, and is especially liked by readers who use a stand.Featured Want local vibe coding?

A ManpowerGroup report explains why. Written by Erin Carson, Managing Editor, News & FeaturesManaging Editor, News & Features Feb. 10, 2026 at 5:55 p.m. PT MirageC/Getty ImagesFollow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.ZDNET's key takeawaysDespite mass AI adoption, workers' confidence in the tech fell. One factor could be a lack of training.Companies are looking for ways to mitigate frustration.For every process or workflow where AI saves time and boosts efficiency, there are a half dozen that leave Tabby Farrar's team feeling like the technology is useless. Farrar is head of search at the UK-based SEO and web design agency Candour. Digital marketing, like nearly every other industry, is heatedly debating the topic of AI. And though her team is keen to embrace the benefits of working faster and more efficiently, and of clawing back time otherwise spent on less interesting tasks, it doesn't always work that way. Also: 95% of business applications of AI have failed. Here's whyAI can generate product lifestyle imagery for clients who don't have any, but it hallucinates or misses key points when creating executive summaries of data. Refining a prompt to help assign categories to datasets could take so long, Farrar might as well have done the job manually. \"As a manager, I'm trying to get the team more on board with AI stuff, because it's the future of so many industries,\" Farrar said. On the other hand, \"There's just so many people going, 'I have lost two hours of my day trying to make this thing work.'\"Farrar and her team aren't the only ones navigating the gap between what AI promises and what it can actually do -- and perhaps losing faith in the meantime. Worker anxiety will cause real problemsA January study from workforce solutions firm ManpowerGroup found that for the first time in three years, workers' confidence in AI declined, dropping 18% while adoption grew by 13% year over year. The divergence in those numbers may not only signal that the honeymoon phase with AI is over, but also serve as a wake-up call for organizations about how they implement AI tools in the workplace. \"You can't have an intimidated workforce and be fully productive. That anxiety is going to cause real problems,\" said Mara Stefan, VP of global insights for ManpowerGroup.Other studies paint similar portraits of disconnect. An EY report from November found that while 9 in 10 employees use AI at work, only 28% of organizations can translate that into \"high-value outcomes.\" \"Our research shows why: Employees may be saving a few hours here and there, but nothing that fundamentally changes how work gets done or how the business performs,\" the report said.For some, trying to prevent this erosion of workers' confidence is a part-time job. Also: 5 ways you can stop testing AI and start scaling it responsibly in 2026Randall Tinfow, CEO of REACHUM, an AI-powered learning platform based in Scranton, Pa., estimates he spends about 20 hours of his 70-hour work week vetting AI tools and partners, so as not to turn them loose on his employees indiscriminately. While platforms like Claude Code are saving software developers at REACHUM significant time, not everything is as effective. Tinfow sees a disparity between how some AI tools are marketed and what they can actually do. Even working at a company built around AI, Tinfow's team has run into issues with tasks like text generation in images, where certain AI tools just didn't deliver. \"There's so much noise, and I don't want our team to get distracted by that, so I'm the one who will take a look at something, decide whether it is reasonable or garbage, and then give it to the team to work with,\" Tinfow said.Boosting confidenceThat misalignment of expectations and reality could be one key reason for the confidence drop, said Kristin Ginn, founder of trnsfrmAItn, an organization that works with companies on AI adoption, focusing on the human workforce involved. Marketing demos make it all look easy, but business leaders have to make sure workers understand the trial-and-error and refinement that may lie ahead. There's also a psychological element at play. ManpowerGroup's study found that 89% of respondents feel comfortable in their current role. For many, they've done their jobs one way for a long time. Also: 5 ways rules and regulations can help guide your AI innovation\"If you're now starting to look at how you can use AI for the same task, you all of a sudden have to put a lot more mental effort into trying to figure out how to do this in a completely different way,\" Ginn said, \"That loss of the routine, the confidence of how I'm doing it, that can also just go back to the human nature to avoid change.\"Additionally, Stefan discussed the role adequate training plays in maintaining confidence. More than half of respondents (56%) reported no recent training or access to mentorship (57%).\"The organizations and the companies that figure out how to address that, how to make employees feel better about the use of technology, the training, and the context… those are the organizations that are going to benefit the most,\" Stefan said.Looking for gemsBack at the digital marketing agency Candour, Farrar said the company has a variety of tactics to help balance the quest for innovation with the day-to-day challenges of a technology that still has a way to go. Candour builds in extra time to account for the fact that everyone is learning, frames experiments as \"test and learn\" to mitigate stress, and has appointed a \"champion\" to stay abreast of developments in AI. The agency's chief marketing officer has led training sessions, and Farrar also does regular check-ins with her team. She's open with them about feeling frustrated sometimes, too.Also: Turn AI chaos into a career opportunity by preparing for these 4 scenariosAnd some efforts have proven fruitful, like the creation of a Gemini Gem trained on brand and tone-of-voice guidelines that can generate quotes a client can then tweak and approve for use in media. Candour's innovation lead is building tools that will more specifically meet the company's needs using APIs from companies like OpenAI. Farrar described how quickly their attitude toward AI images changed after the launch of Google's Nano Banana -- for the better. Still, there's a long road ahead. \"If I am going to sideline some of my work over to these tools,\" Farrar said, \"I want to be able to trust that it's going to do as good a job as I would do.\"Featured Want local vibe coding?

Close Home Tech Computing Tablets This handheld e-reader has effectively replaced my Kindle, and the price is hard to beat The DuRobo Krono is one of the few e-reading devices that fits comfortably in my pants. Written by Maria Diaz, Staff WriterStaff Writer Feb. 10, 2026 at 5:45 p.m. PT DuRobo Krono ZDNET's key takeaways The DuRobo Krono is a smartphone-sized ePaper tablet, available for $280. The Android-based Krono is meant to be a distraction-free device for reading, note-taking, and productivity. Following a successful Kickstarter campaign, the Krono is now shipping to customers. View now at Durobo Follow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.As an avid book lover, I'm a sucker for a great e-reader. But the problem is that many of these devices are way too limited to become a companion device. This is why I loved the TCL Nxtpaper tablet so much. There's another device, however: the new DuRobo Krono is here to address that tablet's downfall: it's a pocket e-reader and productivity device that is finally available for purchase.Also: I stopped using a dedicated e-reader when I found out my tablet could do this insteadAdmittedly, I am biased. I've been using a prototype of the DuRobo Krono for a couple of months, and it's done what no e-reader has before: it's the only one that has replaced my Kindle while traveling. As an adult, I've never traveled without my Kindle because I like being able to read on the plane and before bed. I could read on my phone with the Kindle app, but the eye-friendly ePaper display hits the spot better than any other device. Maria Diaz/ZDNETDuRobo markets the Krono as a \"focus hub,\" offering more functionalities than a Kindle, but less digital clutter than a smartphone. The DuRobo Krono is small and lightweight enough to make a compelling Kindle replacement, and its added features bring it over the top. Describing the DuRobo Krono as a simple e-reader is a major injustice. It's an e-paper Android tablet that works as a smartphone-sized productivity device. Its long battery life and Android-based OS make it more reliable than your average e-reader, without being as cumbersome or heavy as even a Kindle. Also: No Matter? No problem! Imagine one smart home app to control all your devicesI've sung the praises of the TCL Nxtpaper 11 tablet for quite some time, and the only drawback I've found is that it's simply too large and heavy to read comfortably in bed when I hold it up. The Kindle is much smaller, but the more compact DuRobo Krono is lighter than all of them, weighing 6.13 ounces -- about the same as my husband's iPhone 13. Maria Diaz/ZDNET\"Krono was created for thinkers and creators who crave mental clarity,\" a DuRoBo spokesperson recently said about the device. \"By combining thoughtful design, open software, and intelligent assistance, we're giving people a new kind of digital space—one that helps them focus, reflect, and create without distractions.\"Also: The 13 most useful smart home devices I saw at CES 2026 (and would buy if I could)The Krono features a built-in AI assistant that enables easy note recording by simply pressing a button, which then transcribes and summarizes the notes for you -- a feature that has turned out to be quite convenient for me as a writer. Maria Diaz/ZDNETI use the Spark feature to dictate to the Krono and share thoughts and story ideas. The device then transcribes the information, which I can access as needed or use the built-in AI to generate a summary. The DuRobo Krono also features a built-in AI assistant called Libby AI, which can be accessed from the home screen by double-pressing the Smart Dial. Libby AI can respond to prompts similar to those of other popular AI assistants, including ChatGPT. It can also generate summaries, provide news updates, and help you create outlines.Also: Why the Mini LED TV I recommend to most people in 2026 isn't made by TCL or SamsungA 6.1-inch Carta 1200 HD display supports 300 ppi and color temperature adjustments, and is flanked by a rotating dial on the left and a wake button on the right. You can rotate the Smart Dial to adjust the display's brightness or long-press it to quickly record a voice note. Maria Diaz/ZDNETThe battery life is outstanding, especially when the Krono is used mostly for reading. It has a 3,950mAh battery, which is about midrange among smartphones. Yet the Krono is so efficient that I can go weeks without charging it. During my week at CES, I used the DuRobo Krono nightly to read and take notes with the AI assistant, and after six days of use, the battery only consumed about a third of its capacity. ZDNET's buying adviceIn my experience, the Durobo Krono is ideal for professionals, readers, or individuals seeking a mostly distraction-free device that is lightweight and slim enough to fit in a pocket. It's a good fit for users who prefer reading books, articles, or even PDFs without phone glare or pesky notifications. The DuRobo Krono features 128GB of storage, allowing it to handle a wide range of documents, apps, voice recordings, and books. It's now commercially available, with a preorder price of $280, and orders are shipping now.Featured reviews I spent weeks with Alexa on the Echo Show 11, and it was awesome (until I started fact-checking) Sony LinkBuds Clip vs. Bose QuietComfort Open: This model wins big I replaced my bedroom TV with a $180 Roku projector - and don't regret it I found the Lenovo ThinkPad to rule them all - and its modular RAM changes everything I spent weeks with Alexa on the Echo Show 11, and it was awesome (until I started fact-checking) Sony LinkBuds Clip vs. Bose QuietComfort Open: This model wins big I replaced my bedroom TV with a $180 Roku projector - and don't regret it I found the Lenovo ThinkPad to rule them all - and its modular RAM changes everything Editorial standards Show Comments Log In to Comment Community Guidelines Related How I turned my Android tablet into a dedicated e-reader (and it works on iPad, too) I wasn't looking to ditch my Kindle, but this Android e-reader convinced me big time Why I replaced my Kindle with an iPad Mini for reading ebooks - and don't regret it"

Consider these tweaks before upgrading. Written by Jada Jones, EditorEditor Feb. 10, 2026 at 5:42 p.m. PT Jada Jones/ZDNETFollow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.ZDNET's key takeawaysIf you're mulling a headphone upgrade, try these tips first.Updating firmware fixes more performance issues than you'd think.Using different EQ settings for different media can liven the audio performance.New headphones regularly hit the market, and as someone who often wears the latest and greatest ones, I can attest that the novelty wears off more quickly than with other consumer electronics. Headphones have a surprisingly lengthy lifespan, and if curiosity alone is what's driving you to consider buying a new pair, try tinkering with your current pair before welcoming a potential case of buyer's remorse.Also: Spotify vs. Apple Music: I've used both music streaming services, and my choice is clearIf your headphones are still comfortable, hold their battery well, and you're satisfied with their audio performance, but you're feeling bored with them, here are some tips to rekindle the romance between you and your daily driver.Problem: Buggy, low-performing, or connectivity issuesSolution: Update your firmwareHeadphone firmware updates don't arrive often, but when they do, they can include significant changes that completely change your experience in minutes. Your headphones' digital signal processing is usually updated via firmware, which can improve frequency response, noise cancellation, Bluetooth connection stability, and power management.Also: I spoke with Bluetooth reps about the future of connected audio, and it's cooler than I expectedFollowing a firmware update, it's not uncommon to notice that your headphones sound better, their noise cancellation feels smoother, their microphone call quality is enhanced, or their transparency mode sounds more natural. By keeping your headphones updated, you may find they're a totally different pair than when you first bought them.It's easy to turn on your headphones, have them automatically connect to your phone, and rarely open their companion app. However, you've likely missed the notification to update your headphones' firmware, and they won't update themselves. Problem: They sound boringSolution: Tinker with EQMaintaining the same EQ settings across the different media you consume can lead to a flat or boring-sounding response. However, a well-applied EQ setting can bring out parts of a song you've never noticed before, or make your favorite podcast sound clearer than ever.Also: Are the Sonos Ace still worth it in 2026? I've tested dozens of headphones, and it's a resounding yesSome people avoid their headphones' equalizer because they feel intimidated by the numbers and symbols that represent frequency components. Many headphone apps include a five or six-band equalizer, and even if you don't understand what you're looking at, your ears will translate the different frequencies for you.You'll immediately notice a sonic difference, and altered EQ settings can be more impactful than purchasing new headphones, especially if your budget is under $450.Problem: You can't get that new pair out of your headSolution: Spend one-on-one time with your current pairWhen you get a new pair of headphones, you're more likely to put them on and pay close attention to how they feel and sound. Then, you fall back into your typical pattern of wearing them while completing other tasks, such as working, commuting, exercising, or traveling, and the headphones fade into the background again.Also: Are the Sonos Ace still worth it in 2026? I've tested dozens of headphones, and it's a resounding yesOnce you update your headphones and tinker with the audio settings, sit down and intently focus on their audio response. Reset your headphones' headband and ensure they're in an optimal position for audio performance and comfort. There's a chance you have the upgrade itch because you've exhausted one listening mode, and you need a refresh to fall in love again. The bottom lineModern headphones are preference-focused, and hardware or software upgrades are incremental. Thus, certain brands produce headphones tailored to specific lifestyles or software ecosystems. Once you've found the brand that works best for you, there's a good chance you don't need to upgrade within that same brand just yet. Apple's AirPods Max (2020), Sony's WH-1000XM4 (2020), and Bose's QuietComfort 45 (2021) are great examples of this; they each serve their target audiences well, and continued updates only make them better. If you've met anyone with these headphones, I'm confident they'll tell you they've had them for years and have no desire to upgrade.Also: The best headphones and earbuds of 2026To put this idea in perspective, the re-released AirPods Max (2024) feature the same hardware as the 2020 version, aside from the introduction of a USB-C port. Bose hasn't updated the drivers in its premium headphones since 2019, but has released two new pairs since then. If your headphones are five years old or less, don't rush to upgrade yet. It's less likely that you need a new pair altogether; you may just need new experiences with your current pair. When it is time to upgrade, ZDNET has tested dozens of headphones and hand-picked the best ones.Featured Want local vibe coding?

Written by Jada Jones, EditorEditor Feb. 10, 2026 at 5:36 p.m. PT Kyle Kucharski/ZDNETFollow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.ZDNET's key takeawaysMicrosoft is adopting Bluetooth LE Audio in some of its Windows 11 PCs.Bluetooth LE Audio brings audio sharing and super wideband to Windows 11.Your laptop and hearing device must be compatible with Bluetooth LE Audio.Microsoft is rolling out shared audio support to compatible Windows 11 PCs, allowing users to broadcast audio from the PC to two compatible audio accessories. Some PC models received this feature last October and November, while others received it as recently as late January. In a blog post, Microsoft explains that users can share music with a friend or watch a movie together while traveling. To try this feature, users can enable their compatible Windows 11 Copilot + PC in the Windows Dev or Beta Channels and install the latest updates via Windows Update.Also: Microsoft said my PC was 'too old' to run Windows 11 - how I upgraded in 5 minutes anywayIf your PC is not yet compatible, Microsoft says to look out for driver updates via Windows Updates. Once your device is compatible, a \"Shared audio (preview)\" tile should appear in Quick Settings.Microsoft's implementation of the audio-sharing feature builds on the Bluetooth LE Audio connectivity standard, which enables audio sharing between Bluetooth-enabled devices. Bluetooth LE is the architecture that supports Auracast, a feature within Bluetooth LE Audio that enables a single source to broadcast to an unlimited number of nearby audio receivers.Is it Auracast? Microsoft omits the word Auracast from its blog post. While the Auracast protocol supports broadcasting to an unlimited number of nearby audio receivers, Microsoft's hardware implementation limits the number of audio receivers its PCs can broadcast to two. (Limiting the number of audio receivers that PCs can broadcast to is entirely within Microsoft's discretion as a manufacturer, as I learned from the Bluetooth Special Interest Group earlier this year.)Also: What is Bluetooth 6.0? Why the newest audio connectivity standard is worth getting excited aboutMicrosoft's blog post says consumers should look for compatible Bluetooth headphones, earbuds, and hearing aids that advertise LE Audio support. Auracast-supported devices can still support the new Windows Bluetooth LE feature, even though Microsoft doesn't specify it. What else comes with LE Audio on Windows 11?Last year, Microsoft announced that certain Windows 11 PCs will support super wideband (SWB), a Bluetooth LE Audio feature that enhances voice clarity. SWB replaces older, less efficient hands-free profiles within the Classic Bluetooth radio. SWB's sample rate is 32 kHz, ideal for voice chat while gaming and for video calls.Also: I spoke with Bluetooth reps about the future of connected audio, and it's cooler than I expectedOn top of SWB, select Windows 11 PCs support SWB stereo, which uses two audio channels for audio output, creating a more immersive and expansive soundstage for gaming and movie-watching. Both your laptop and headphones, earbuds, or hearing aids must be compatible with LE Audio to experience it. Which Windows PCs support LE Audio?As of February 2026, these Windows 11 PC support Bluetooth LE Audio:Surface Laptop, 13.8-inch and 15-inch* | Qualcomm Snapdragon XSurface Laptop for Business, 13.8 and 15-inch* | Qualcomm Snapdragon XSurface Pro, 13-inch | Qualcomm Snapdragon XSurface Pro for Business, 13-inch | Qualcomm Snapdragon XSurface Laptop, 13-inch | Qualcomm Snapdragon XSurface Laptop for Business, 13-inch | Qualcomm Snapdragon XSurface Pro, 12-inch | Qualcomm Snapdragon XSurface Pro for Business, 12-inch | Qualcomm Snapdragon XSamsung Galaxy Book4 Edge | Qualcomm Snapdragon XAlso: After setting up Windows 11, these 9 steps are non-negotiable for meAccording to Microsoft, these laptops are up next for LE Audio support: Samsung Galaxy Book5 360 | Intel Core Ultra Series 200Samsung Galaxy Book5 Pro | Intel Core Ultra Series 200Samsung Galaxy Book5 Pro 360 | Intel Core Ultra Series 200Featured Want local vibe coding?

Beth Mole – Feb 10, 2026 8:21 pm | 95 Credit: DeFodi Images Credit: DeFodi Images Text settings Story text Size Small Standard Large Width * Standard Wide Links Standard Orange * Subscribers only Learn more Minimize to nav The Food and Drug Administration has refused to review Moderna’s application for an mRNA flu vaccine, the company revealed Tuesday. While the move came as a surprise to the high-profile vaccine maker, it is just the latest hostility toward vaccines—and mRNA vaccines in particular—from an agency overseen by the fervent anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy Jr. In his first year in office, Kennedy has already dramatically slashed childhood vaccine recommendations and canceled $500 million in research funding for mRNA vaccines against potential pandemic threats. In a news release late Tuesday, Moderna said it was blindsided by the FDA’s refusal, which the FDA cited as being due to the design of the company’s Phase 3 trial for its mRNA flu vaccine, dubbed mRNA-1010. Specifically, the FDA’s rejection was over the comparator vaccine Moderna used. In the trial, which enrolled nearly 41,000 participants and cost hundreds of millions of dollars, Moderna compared the safety and efficacy of mRNA-1010 to licensed standard-dose influenza vaccines, including Fluarix, made by GlaxoSmithKline. The trial found that mRNA-1010 was superior to the comparators. Moderna said the FDA reviewed and accepted its trial design on at least two occasions (in April 2024 and again in August 2025) before it applied for approval of mRNA-1010. It also noted that Fluarix has been used as a comparator vaccine in previous flu vaccine trials, which tested vaccines that went on to earn approval. But in a letter dated February 3, Vinay Prasad, the FDA’s top vaccine regulator under the Trump administration, informed Moderna that the agency does not consider the trial “adequate and well-controlled” because the comparator vaccine “does not reflect the best-available standard of care.” In its news release, Moderna noted that neither the FDA’s regulation nor its guidance to industry makes any reference to a requirement of the “best-available standard of care” in comparators. “This decision by [the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research], which did not identify any safety or efficacy concerns with our product, does not further our shared goal of enhancing America’s leadership in developing innovative medicines,” Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel said in the release. “It should not be controversial to conduct a comprehensive review of a flu vaccine submission that uses an FDA-approved vaccine as a comparator in a study that was discussed and agreed on with CBER prior to starting.” Moderna said it has requested a meeting with the FDA to understand the basis of the refusal. “We look forward to engaging with CBER to understand the path forward as quickly as possible so that America’s seniors, and those with underlying conditions, continue to have access to American-made innovations.” The company noted that mRNA-1010 has already been accepted for review in the European Union, Canada, and Australia.

Credit: SpaceX Text settings Story text Size Small Standard Large Width * Standard Wide Links Standard Orange * Subscribers only Learn more Minimize to nav The upgraded Super Heavy booster slated to launch SpaceX’s next Starship flight has completed cryogenic proof testing, clearing a hurdle that resulted in the destruction of the company’s previous booster. SpaceX announced the milestone in a social media post Tuesday: “Cryoproof operations complete for the first time with a Super Heavy V3 booster. This multi-day campaign tested the booster’s redesigned propellant systems and its structural strength.” Ground teams at Starbase, Texas, rolled the 237-foot-tall (72.3-meter) stainless-steel booster out of its factory and transported it a few miles away to Massey’s Test Site last week. The test crew first performed a pressure test on the rocket at ambient temperatures, then loaded super-cold liquid nitrogen into the rocket four times over six days, putting the booster through repeated thermal and pressurization cycles. The nitrogen is a stand-in for the cryogenic methane and liquid oxygen that will fill the booster’s propellant tanks on launch day. The proof test is notable because it moves engineers closer to launching the first test flight of an upgraded version of SpaceX’s mega-rocket named Starship V3 or Block 3. SpaceX launched the previous version, Starship V2, five times last year, but the first three test flights failed. The last two flights achieved SpaceX’s goals, and the company moved on to V3. Better results this time The Super Heavy booster originally assigned to the first Starship V3 test flight failed during a pressure test in November. The rocket’s liquid oxygen tank ruptured under pressure, and SpaceX scrapped the booster and moved on to the next in line—Booster 19. This Super Heavy vehicle appears have sailed through stress testing, and SpaceX returned the booster to the factory early Monday. There, technicians will mount 33 Raptor engines to the bottom of the rocket and install the booster’s grid fins. These components are changed from Starship V2. The Raptor engines set to debut on Starship V3 produce more thrust and include changes to improve reliability, according to SpaceX. The Raptor 3s are lighter with plumbing and sensors integrated into the engine’s main structure, eliminating the requirement for self-contained heat shields between the engines at the base of the rocket. The new booster design only uses three grid fins, not four, to provide controllability during descent. The aerosurfaces help stabilize the rocket as it returns to Earth for recovery. The hot-staging ring at the top of the new version of the Super Heavy booster is integrated with the rocket to enable its return to Earth for reuse. The ring was jettisoned and expended on previous Starship flights. Vapors from the boil-off of cryogenic liquid nitrogen surround the 237-foot-tall (72.3-meter) Super Heavy booster.

Credit: SpaceX After receiving its engines and grid fins, the Super Heavy booster will roll out to the launch pad at Starbase. SpaceX’s launch team will fill it with methane and liquid oxygen for a test-firing of its 33 engines. Meanwhile, the first of SpaceX’s upgraded Starship vehicles—essentially the upper stage that flies on top of the Super Heavy booster—will travel to the Massey’s Test Site for its own cryogenic proof test campaign. It is also expected to undergo a static fire test of its six Raptor engines. Assuming that all goes according to plan, SpaceX could be in position to launch the first Starship V3 test flight before the end of March. This will be the 12th full-scale Starship/Super Heavy test flight overall, and the mission will likely follow the same trajectory as previous flights, with Starship arcing halfway around the world from South Texas to a controlled reentry and splashdown in the Indian Ocean. With the upcoming launch, SpaceX is eager to prove Starship V3’s readiness for more ambitious test flights, including an important orbital refueling experiment considered a stepping stone toward sending future Starships to the Moon, Mars, and other distant destinations. NASA officials are closely watching Starship V3’s development because the refueling demonstration is on the critical path for the agency’s Artemis lunar program. A human-rated version of Starship is NASA’s primary option for a Moon lander to ferry astronauts to and from the lunar surface on the Artemis III mission, the next Artemis flight after the Artemis II circumlunar mission that is awaiting liftoff in the coming weeks.

    "summary": "Discord is the latest company looking to bolster its child safety (again). Starting in March, all users will have a \"teen-appropriate experience\" by default. Unlocking adult content and age-gated spaces will require a (usually one-time) verification process. However, following blowback, the company appears to have pivoted. It now says its age prediction AI will verify the identities of “the majority of adult users” without requiring a manual age check.\nThe platform's big safety update encompasses communication settings, restricted access to age-gated spaces and content filtering. Users who aren't verified as adults will see blurred sensitive content. In addition, age-restricted channels, servers and app commands will be blocked. DMs and friend requests from unknown users will be routed to a separate inbox.\nIf you're an adult who didn’t pass the automatic age check, removing these restrictions will require one of two verification methods at launch. You can take a selfie video for age estimation or submit a government ID to Discord's vendor partners. (Let's just hope the age estimations work better than Roblox's.) The company stresses that the video selfies you submit for age estimation never leave your device. And it claims ID documents sent to its vendor partners are deleted quickly, \"in most cases, immediately after age confirmation.\"\nAlthough Discord says the process will be one-and-done for most people required to submit manual verification, some may be required to submit multiple forms. Its original announcement stated that additional verification options would be introduced, including an age inference model that runs in the background. However, following backlash to its initial announcement, the company now suggests that the inference model will be the norm for most adults.\n“For most adults, age verification won’t be required, as Discord’s age inference model uses account information such as account tenure, device and activity data and aggregated, high-level patterns across Discord communities,” the company wrote in a statement sent to Engadget on Tuesday. “Discord does not use private messages or any message content in this process.”\nThis isn’t the company’s first attempt at beefing up its child safety measures. In 2023, it banned teen dating channels and AI-generated CSAM. Later that year, it added content filters and automated warnings. Those changes followed an NBC News report that 35 adults had been prosecuted on charges of \"kidnapping, grooming or sexual assault\" that involved Discord communication.\nAlongside today’s changes, Discord is recruiting for a new Teen Council. The group will include 10 to 12 teens aged 13 to 17. The company says this \"will help ensure Discord understands — not assumes — what teens need, how they build meaningful connections, and what makes them feel safe and supported online.\" This sounds like the corporate equivalent of the parenting advice: “Don’t just talk to your children; listen to them, too.”\nThe child safety changes will start rolling out globally in early March. Both new and existing users may be required to submit verification for adult content.\nUpdate, February 10, 2026, 5:57 PM ET: This story has been updated to add Discord’s clarification and statement that claims most adults won’t need to conduct a manual age check.\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/social-media/discord-will-soon-require-age-verification-to-access-adult-content-140000218.html?src=rss",

Jon Brodkin – Feb 10, 2026 2:29 pm | 74 Credit: Getty Images | Riccardo Milani Credit: Getty Images | Riccardo Milani Text settings Story text Size Small Standard Large Width * Standard Wide Links Standard Orange * Subscribers only Learn more Minimize to nav Wikipedia editors are discussing whether to blacklist Archive.today because the archive site was used to direct a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack against a blogger who wrote a post in 2023 about the mysterious website’s anonymous maintainer. In a request for comment page, Wikipedia’s volunteer editors were presented with three options. Option A is to remove or hide all Archive.today links and add the site to the spam blacklist. Option B is to deprecate Archive.today, discouraging future link additions while keeping the existing archived links. Option C is to do nothing and maintain the status quo. Option A in particular would be a huge change, as more than 695,000 links to Archive.today are used across 400,000 or so Wikipedia pages. Archive.today, also known as Archive.is, is a website that saves snapshots of webpages and is commonly used to bypass news paywalls. “Archive.today uses advanced scraping methods, and is generally considered more reliable than the Internet Archive,” the Wikipedia request for comment said. “Due to concerns about botnets, linkspamming, and how the site is run, the community decided to blacklist it in 2013. In 2016, the decision was overturned, and archive.today was removed from the spam blacklist.” Discussion among editors has been ongoing since February 7. “Wikipedia’s need for verifiable citations is absolutely not more important than the security of users,” one editor in favor of blacklisting wrote. “We need verifiable citations so that we can maintain readers’ trust, however, in order to be trustworthy our references also have to be safe to access.” Archive would be hard to replace On the other side, an editor who supported Option C wrote that “Archive.today contains a vast amount of archives available nowhere else. Not on Wayback Machine, nowhere. It is the second largest archive provider across all Wikimedia sites. Removal/blockage of this site will be disruptive daily for thousands of editors and readers. It will result in a huge proliferation of {{dead link}} tags that will never be resolved.” Several posts mentioned an ongoing FBI case that could eventually make the Archive.today links useless anyway. Some said it would be better to act now than to have Option A forced on them later without a backup plan. One editor supported starting with Option B and eventually shifting to Option A with “the proper end goal being the WMF [Wikimedia Foundation] supporting some sort of archive system, whether their own original or directly supporting the Internet Archive’s work so it can be done more systematically.” Some discussion centered on copyright infringement, given that Archive.today publishes copies of many copyrighted articles. “On the general problem of linking to copyright infringement: perhaps the Wikimedia Foundation can work on ways to establish legally licensed archives of major paywalled sites, in partnership with archives such as the Internet Archive,” one editor wrote. “It would be challenging given the business model of those sites, but maybe a workable compromise can be established that manages how many Wikipedia editors [have] access at a given time.” Malicious code in CAPTCHA page The DDoS attack being discussed by Wikipedia editors was targeted at the Gyrovague blog written by Jani Patokallio. Last month, “the maintainers of Archive.today injected malicious code in order to perform a distributed denial of service attack against a person they were in dispute with,” the Wikipedia request for comment says. “Every time a user encounters the CAPTCHA page, their Internet connection is used to attack a certain individual’s blog.” The trustworthiness of Archive.today was discussed in light of evidence that the site’s founder threatened to create “a new category of AI porn” in retaliation against the blogger. The AI porn threat was mentioned by several editors. “I echo others [that Option] A is looking like something we’ll have to do eventually, anyways, and at least this way we have a chance to do it on our terms,” one editor wrote. “I hate to break it to you, but even if the FBI thing goes nowhere, a website whose operator apparently threatens to create AI porn in retaliation against enemies, using their names, isn’t a trustworthy mirror, and isn’t going to remain one.” One editor reported being “miserable” about supporting Option A, “but we cannot permit websites to rope our readers into being part of DDoS attacks.” Moreover, “The fact is that most of the archive.today links on Wikipedia are not an attempt to save URLs that have now gone dead that the Internet Archive cannot handle, but efforts to bypass paywalls, which is convenient, but illegal. It’s strange that we accept links to archive.today for this purpose but don’t accept the same for Anna’s Archive or Sci-Hub,” the editor wrote. Patokallio told us in an email today, “it’s true that there simply are no alternatives to archive.today for many sources that archive.org does not/cannot cover,” and that he hopes the Wikipedia request for comment “leads to the Wikimedia Foundation creating one as suggested by multiple commenters in the thread.” The Wikimedia Foundation, the nonprofit that hosts Wikipedia, chimed in on the discussion today. “Our view is that the value to verifiability that the site provides must be weighed against the security risks and violation of the trust of the people who click these links,” wrote Eric Mill, head of the foundation’s product safety and integrity group. “We (WMF) encourage the English Wikipedia community to carefully weigh the situation before making a decision on this unusual case.” Noting that “Archive.today’s owner has not been deterred from continuing the ongoing DDoS,” Mill wrote that “the same actions that make archive.today unsafe may also reduce its usefulness for verifying content on Wikipedia. If the owners are willing to abuse their position to further their goals through malicious code, then it also raises questions about the integrity of the archive it hosts.” It’s possible the Wikimedia Foundation will act even if the volunteer editors decide to maintain the status quo. “We know that WMF intervention is a big deal, but we also have not ruled it out, given the seriousness of the security concern for people who click the links that appear across many wikis,” Mill wrote. Blogger tried to uncover founder’s identity The Wikipedia request for comments acknowledged that whether to blacklist would be a difficult decision. There are “significant concerns for readers’ safety, as well as the long-term stability and integrity of the service,” but “a significant amount of people also think that mass-removing links to Archive.today may harm verifiability, and that the service is harder to censor than certain other archiving sites,” it said. An update to the request for comments yesterday indicated that the attack temporarily stopped, but the malicious code had been reactivated. “Please do not visit the archive without blocking network requests to gyrovague.com to avoid being part of the attack!” it said. The code’s first public mention was apparently in a Hacker News thread on January 14, and Patokallio wrote about the DDoS in a February 1 blog post. “Every 300 milliseconds, as long as the CAPTCHA page is open, this makes a request to the search function of my blog using a random string, ensuring the response cannot be cached and thus consumes resources,” he wrote. The Javascript code in the Archive.today CAPTCHA page is as follows: setInterval(function() { fetch(\"https://gyrovague.com/?s=\" + Math.random().toString(36).substring(2, 3 + Math.random() * 8), { referrerPolicy: \"no-referrer\", mode: \"no-cors\" }); }, 300); In August 2023, Patokallio wrote a post attempting to uncover the identity of Archive.today founder “Denis Petrov,” which seems to be an alias. Patokallio wasn’t able to figure out who the founder is but cobbled together various tidbits from Internet searches, including a Stack Exchange post that mentioned another potential alias, “Masha Rabinovich.” Patokallio seemed to be driven by curiosity and was impressed by Archive.today’s work. “It’s a testament to their persistence that [they’ve] managed to keep this up for over 10 years, and I for one will be buying Denis/Masha/whoever a well deserved cup of coffee,” Patokallio’s 2023 post said. In his post this month, Patokallio said his 2023 blog “gathered some 10,000 views and a bit [of] discussion on Hacker News, but didn’t exactly set the blogosphere on fire. And indeed, absolutely nothing happened for the next two years and a bit.” FBI case revives interest in 2023 blog But in October 2025, the FBI sent a subpoena to domain registrar Tucows seeking “subscriber information on [the] customer behind archive.today” in connection with “a federal criminal investigation being conducted by the FBI.” We wrote about the subpoena, and our story included a link to Patokallio’s 2023 blog post in a sentence that said, “There are several indications that the [Archive.today] founder is from Russia.” In an email to Ars, Patokallio told us that the DDoS attack “appears to be because you kindly mentioned my blog in your Nov 8, 2025 story.” Patokallio added that he is “as mystified by this as you probably are.” Articles about the subpoena by The Verge and Heise Online also linked to Patokallio’s 2023 blog post. We emailed Archive.today’s webmaster address today to ask for comment on the Wikipedia discussion. We received an email reply that said, “Ok, but first remove the paragraph with gyrovague excerpt from your previous article.” On January 8, 2026, Patokallio’s hosting company, Automattic, notified him that it received a GDPR [General Data Protection Regulation] complaint from a “Nora Puchreiner” alleging that the 2023 post “contains extensive personal data… presented in a narrative that is defamatory in tone and context.” Patokallio said that after he submitted a rebuttal, “Automattic sided with me and left the post up.” Patokallio said he also “received a politely worded email from archive.today’s webmaster asking me to take down the post for a few months” on January 10. The email was classified as spam by Gmail, and he didn’t see it until five days later, he said. In the meantime, the DDoS started. Patokallio said he replied to the webmaster’s email on January 15 and again on January 20 but didn’t hear back. He tried a third time on January 25, saying he would not take down the blog post but offered to “change some wording that you feel is being misrepresented.” Emails threatened AI porn and other scams Patokallio posted what he called a lightly redacted copy of the resulting email thread. The first email from the Archive.today webmaster said, “I do not mind the post, but the issue is: journos from mainstream media (Heise, Verge, etc) cherry-pick just a couple of words from your blog, and then construct very different narratives having your post the only citable source; then they cite each other and produce a shitty result to present for a wide audience.” In a later email, “Nora Puchreiner” wrote, “I do not care on your blog and its content. I just need the links from Heise and other media to be 404.” One message threatened to investigate “your Nazi grandfather” and “vibecode a gyrovague.gay dating app.” Another threatened to create a public association between Patokallio’s name and AI porn. A Tumblr blog post apparently written by the Archive.today founder seems to generally confirm the emails’ veracity, but says the original version threatened to create “a patokallio.gay dating app,” not “a gyrovague.gay dating app.” The Tumblr blog has several other recent posts criticizing Patokallio and accusing him of hiding his real name. However, the Gyrovague blog shows Patokallio’s name in a sidebar and discloses that he works for Google in Sydney, Australia, while stating that the blog posts contain only his personal views. In one email, Patokallio included a link to Wikipedia’s page on the Streisand effect, a name for situations in which people seeking to suppress access to information instead draw more public attention to the information they want hidden. The Archive.today site maintainer apparently viewed this as a threat. “And threatening me with Streisand… having such a noble and rare name, which in retaliation could be used for the name of a scam project or become a byword for a new category of AI porn… are you serious?” the email said. Patokallio responded, “No, you’re Streisanding yourself: the DDOS has already drawn more attention to my blog post than it had gotten in the last two years, with zero action on my side.” A subsequent reply in the email thread contained the “Nazi grandfather” and “gay dating app” threats.

Credit: Getty Images | VCG Text settings Story text Size Small Standard Large Width * Standard Wide Links Standard Orange * Subscribers only Learn more Minimize to nav xAI co-founder Tony Wu abruptly announced his resignation from the company late Monday night, the latest in a string of senior executives to leave the Grok-maker in recent months. In a post on social media, Wu expressed warm feelings for his time at xAI, but said it was “time for my next chapter.” The current era is one where “a small team armed with AIs can move mountains and redefine what’s possible,” he wrote. The mention of what “a small team” can do could hint at a potential reason for Wu’s departure. xAI reportedly had 1,200 employees as of March 2025, a number that included AI engineers and those focused more on the X social network. That number also included 900 employees that served solely as “AI tutors,” though roughly 500 of those were reportedly laid off in September. Wu’s departure comes just months after fellow xAI co-founder Igor Babuschkin departed the company in August to start his own AI safety-focused venture capital firm. Co-founders Kyle Kosic and Christian Szegedy also departed the company since its 2023 founding, and co-founder Greg Yang stepped back from the company last month amid complications from chronic Lyme disease. Other recent high-profile xAI departures include general counsel Robert Keele, communications executives Dave Heinzinger and John Stoll, head of product engineering Haofei Wang, and CFO Mike Liberatore, who left for a role at OpenAI after just 102 days of what he called “120+ hour weeks.” A different company Wu leaves a company that is in a very different place than it was when he helped create it in 2023. His departure comes just days after CEO Elon Musk merged xAI with SpaceX, a move Musk says will allow for orbiting data centers and, eventually, “scaling to make a sentient sun to understand the Universe and extend the light of consciousness to the stars!” But some see the move as more of a financial engineering play, combining xAI’s nearly $1 billion a year in losses and SpaceX’s roughly $8 billion in annual profits into a single, more IPO-ready entity. Musk previously rolled social media network X (formerly Twitter) into a unified entity with xAI back in March. At the time of the deal, X was valued at $33 billion, 25 percent less than Musk paid for the social network in 2022. xAI has faced a fresh wave of criticism in recent months over Grok’s willingness to generate sexualized images of minors. That has led to an investigation by California’s attorney general and a police raid of the company’s Paris offices.

Credit: Getty | Nurphoto Text settings Story text Size Small Standard Large Width * Standard Wide Links Standard Orange * Subscribers only Learn more Minimize to nav The National Cancer Institute is using federal funds to study whether cancer can be cured by ivermectin, a cheap, off-patent anti-parasitic and deworming drug that fringe medical groups falsely claimed could treat COVID-19 during the pandemic and have since touted as a cure-all. Large, high-quality clinical trials have resoundingly concluded that ivermectin is not effective against COVID-19. And there is no old or new scientific evidence to support a hypothesis that ivermectin can cure cancer—or justify any such federal expenditure. But, under anti-vaccine Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.—who is otherwise well-known for claiming to have a parasitic worm in his brain—numerous members of the medical fringe are now in powerful federal positions or otherwise hold sway with the administration. During a January 30 event, Anthony Letai, a cancer researcher the Trump administration installed as the director of the NCI in September, said the NCI was pursuing ivermectin. “There are enough reports of it, enough interest in it, that we actually did—ivermectin, in particular—did engage in sort of a better preclinical study of its properties and its ability to kill cancer cells and we’ll probably have those results in a few months. So we are taking it seriously.” The comments were highlighted today in a report from KFF Health News. Ars Technica was also at the event, “Reclaiming Science: The People’s NIH,” which was hosted by the MAHA [Make America Healthy Again] Institute. In the rest of his comments, Letai seemed to make a noticeable effort to temper expectations while also trying to avoid offending any ivermectin believers. “It’s not going to be a cure-all for cancer,” he said. At another point, he said that even if there are signals of anti-cancer properties in the preclinical studies, “I can tell you again, it’s not a really strong signal.” But, he quickly noted, “this doesn’t rule out… individual reports of people having taken it that had a response to their cancer. This doesn’t invalidate their personal experience.” “Ridiculous” KFF noted that among those individual reports is one from Mel Gibson, who said in a January 2025 episode of Joe Rogan’s podcast that a regimen of drugs that includes ivermectin cured stage 4 cancers in three of his friends. The episode has been viewed more than 12 million times. NCI scientists who spoke to KFF under the condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation blasted the funding. “I am shocked and appalled,” one said. “We are moving funds away from so much promising research in order to do a preclinical study based on nonscientific ideas. It’s absurd.” Another called the suggestion that the NCI had previously overlooked ivermectin’s potential “ridiculous.” “This is not a new idea they came up with,” the NCI scientist said. While the revelation that the NCI is funding research based on fringe anecdotes rather than scientific evidence is spurring backlash, it also raises new questions about Letai, who was otherwise a respected cancer researcher prior to taking the role of NCI director. In an interview with STAT News last month, Letai was asked if there were ethical lines he wouldn’t cross for the administration. He responded: “My job is to progress the mission of the National Cancer Institute to reduce suffering from cancer with the resources that I’m given. If it got to a point where I couldn’t do my job, I would feel required to quit.” Beth Mole Senior Health Reporter Beth Mole Senior Health Reporter Beth is Ars Technica’s Senior Health Reporter.

Andrew Cunningham – Feb 10, 2026 1:04 pm | 73 A PC running Windows 11. Credit: Microsoft A PC running Windows 11. Credit: Microsoft Text settings Story text Size Small Standard Large Width * Standard Wide Links Standard Orange * Subscribers only Learn more Minimize to nav Windows 8 is remembered most for its oddball touchscreen-focused full-screen Start menu, but it also introduced a number of under-the-hood enhancements to Windows. One of those was UEFI Secure Boot, a mechanism for verifying PC bootloaders to ensure that unverified software can’t be loaded at startup. Secure Boot was enabled but technically optional for Windows 8 and Windows 10, but it became a formal system requirement for installing Windows starting with Windows 11 in 2021. Secure Boot has relied on the same security certificates to verify bootloaders since 2011, during the development cycle for Windows 8. But those original certificates are set to expire in June and October of this year, something Microsoft is highlighting in a post today. This certificate expiration date isn’t news—Microsoft and most major PC makers have been talking about it for months or years, and behind-the-scenes work to get the Windows ecosystem ready has been happening for some time. And renewing security certificates is a routine occurrence that most users only notice when something goes wrong. But the downside is that the certificate expiration may cause problems for PCs that don’t pull down the patches before the June 2026 deadline. While these PCs will continue to function, expired certificates can prevent Microsoft from patching newly discovered Secure Boot vulnerabilities and can also keep those PCs from booting and installing newer operating system versions that use the new 2023-era certificates. “If a device does not receive the new Secure Boot certificates before the 2011 certificates expire, the PC will continue to function normally, and existing software will keep running,” writes Nuno Costa, a program manager in Microsoft’s Windows Servicing and Delivery division. “However, the device will enter a degraded security state that limits its ability to receive future boot-level protections. As new boot‐level vulnerabilities are discovered, affected systems become increasingly exposed because they can no longer install new mitigations. Over time, this may also lead to compatibility issues, as newer operating systems, firmware, hardware, or Secure Boot–dependent software may fail to load.” Making sure you’ve got the new certificates For most systems, including older ones that aren’t being actively supported by their manufacturers, Microsoft is relying on Windows Update to provide updated certificates. For fully patched, functioning PCs running supported versions of Windows with Secure Boot enabled, the transition should be seamless, and you may in fact already be using the new certificates without realizing it. This is possible because UEFI-based systems have a small amount of NVRAM that can be used to store variables between boots; generally, Windows and Linux operating systems using LVFS for firmware updates should be able to update any given system’s NVRAM with the new certificates. PCs will only have problems deploying the new certificates if NVRAM is full or fragmented in some way, or if the PC manufacturer is shipping buggy firmware that doesn’t support this kind of update. As detailed on a Dell support page, the easiest way to see if your PC has the new certificates is to run a PowerShell command that checks the certificate stored in the “active db,” which is the one currently used to boot the PC. A screenshot from a Windows 11 PC that is already using the new 2023 Secure Boot certificates to boot (the first command has returned “true”) but which does not have the new certificates baked into its UEFI firmware (the second command has returned “false.”) This is normal behavior for older PCs; for newer PCs, check to see if a BIOS update is available.

Andrew Cunningham If the second command returns “true” it means the new certificates are also baked into your PC’s firmware. Newer systems should have BIOS updates available with the new certificates. Andrew Cunningham To check this, right-click either the PowerShell or Terminal app and run it as an Administrator, and type ([System.Text.Encoding]::ASCII.GetString((Get-SecureBootUEFI db).bytes) -match 'Windows UEFI CA 2023'). If this command returns “true,” then your PC is using the new certificate, and you’re good to go. If it returns “false,” here are some steps to enable Windows Update to install the new certificates for you. Make sure you’re running a supported version of Windows. For Windows 11, that means version 24H2 or 25H2. For Windows 10, you need to enroll the PC in the Extended Security Updates (ESU) program, which consumers can do for free after jumping through a couple of hoops. Make sure Secure Boot is enabled in the BIOS and working properly. To check from within Windows, type Windows + R to open a Run window, type msinfo32, and press Enter. In the msinfo32 app, make sure Secure Boot State is set to “on.” Check to see whether there’s a firmware update available for your PC. These may fix bugs preventing the new certificates from being installed. Especially for older PCs that originally shipped with Windows 8 or Windows 10, it may help to do a factory reset of your Secure Boot keys from within your PC’s BIOS settings. This can help ensure that there is enough free space in your PC’s NVRAM to store the new certificates. If you do this on a system with BitLocker encryption enabled, make sure you have your recovery key handy so you can unlock your drive. The second thing to check is the “default db,” which shows whether the new Secure Boot certificates are baked into your PC’s firmware. If they are, even resetting Secure Boot settings to the defaults in your PC’s BIOS will still allow you to boot operating systems that use the new certificates. To check this, open PowerShell or Terminal again and type ([System.Text.Encoding]::ASCII.GetString((Get-SecureBootUEFI dbdefault).bytes) -match 'Windows UEFI CA 2023'). If this command returns “true,” your system is running an updated BIOS with the new Secure Boot certificates built in. Older PCs and systems without a BIOS update installed will return “false” here. Microsoft’s Costa says that “many newer PCs built since 2024, and almost all the devices shipped in 2025, already include the certificates” and won’t need to be updated at all. And PCs several years older than that may be able to get the certificates via a BIOS update. In the US, Dell, HP, Lenovo, and Microsoft all have lists of specific systems and firmware versions, while Asus provides more general information about how to get the new certificates via Windows Update, the MyAsus app, or the Asus website. The oldest of the PCs listed generally date back to 2019 or 2020. If your PC shipped with Windows 11 out of the box, there should be a BIOS update with the new certificates available, though that may not be true of every system that meets the requirements for upgrading to Windows 11. Microsoft encourages home users who can’t install the new certificates to use its customer support services for help. Detailed documentation is also available for IT shops and other large organizations that manage their own updates. “The Secure Boot certificate update marks a generational refresh of the trust foundation that modern PCs rely on at startup,” writes Costa. “By renewing these certificates, the Windows ecosystem is ensuring that future innovations in hardware, firmware, and operating systems can continue to build on a secure, industry‐aligned boot process.” Andrew Cunningham Senior Technology Reporter Andrew Cunningham Senior Technology Reporter Andrew is a Senior Technology Reporter at Ars Technica, with a focus on consumer tech including computer hardware and in-depth reviews of operating systems like Windows and macOS.

There are people on the Internet who want to know all about you! Unfortunately, they don’t have the best of intentions, but Google has some handy tools to address that, and they’ve gotten an upgrade today. The “Results About You” tool can now detect and remove more of your personal information. Plus, the tool for removing non-consensual explicit imagery (NCEI) is faster to use. All you have to do is tell Google your personal details first—that seems safe, right? With today’s upgrade, Results About You gains the ability to find and remove pages that include ID numbers like your passport, driver’s license, and Social Security. You can access the option to add these to Google’s ongoing scans from the settings in Results About You. Just click in the ID numbers section to enable detection. Naturally, Google has to know what it’s looking for to remove it. So you need to provide at least part of those numbers. Google asks for the full driver’s license number, which is fine, as it’s not as sensitive. For your passport and SSN, you only need the last four digits, which is enough for Google to find the full numbers on webpages. ID number results detected. ID number results detected. The NCEI tool is geared toward hiding real, explicit images as well as deepfakes and other types of artificial sexualized content. This kind of content is rampant on the Internet right now due to the rapid rise of AI. What used to require Photoshop skills is now just a prompt away, and some AI platforms hardly do anything to prevent it. Google has made this tool easier to access and faster to report images. You can access it from the three-dot menu on any image that appears in Google’s search results. Just select “remove result” and “It shows a sexual image of me” to begin the removal process. Google will ask if it’s a real image or a deepfake. The company has added the option to add multiple images to a single request, which could save a lot of time if someone is using AI to churn out such content. Sanitizing scans for safer search Neither Results About You nor the NCEI tool works instantly, and they can’t actually remove content from the Internet. But if Google approves the removal request, the content won’t appear in its search results, which is almost as good as not appearing on the Internet as far as most people are concerned. Remnoving explicit images in Google search. Remnoving explicit images in Google search. After adding data to Results About You, Google intermittently scans for that data and will email you alerts so you can quickly remove results. That’s now an option for the NCII tool, too. If you enable it, Google’s system can monitor for new instances of the offending images. Google says it will “proactively filter out” these explicit results for you. This data will be integrated with the Results About You hub so you can see how often they appear. The ID-number scanning is live in Results About You today. Meanwhile, the updated NCEI reporting will be available in the coming days. It will be available in “most countries” and will expand to more over time.

But the van is an unseen hero that keeps the world moving, delivering packages all over the country and transporting food from farm to stores. They haven’t changed much in decades, though. A van is generally a big box with a gas or diesel engine (depending on where you are in the world), and that’s… kinda it, bar a dent or two in the bodywork. Kia’s engineers, riding high on the success of their recent electric vehicles, took notice and did some new things with the PV5, the company’s first electric van. You can spec your PV5 in a number of configurations, and the company already has conversion partners lined up to turn them into just about anything. Of course, camper converters are eyeing them as well, eager to create electric “vanlife” setups. Off the shelf, you can choose between a PV5 Passenger for moving people, a PV5 Cargo for moving things, a PV5 Crew for moving things and people, and a PV5 Chassis Cab to do with as you please. Beneath its modular cabin is the Electric Global Modular For Service, which is part of Kia’s rather fancy-sounding “PBV” strategy. “PBV” means “Platform Beyond Vehicle,” a potential hint at where the brand sees itself going. In this case, it can house a range of battery sizes. In profile, pretty much a conventional one-box van shape. Kia In profile, pretty much a conventional one-box van shape.

Kia There’s a passenger version as well. Kia In the UK, where I live, we get a 52 kWh or 71.2 kWh option with either 120 hp (90 kW) or 160 hp (120 kW). Both options generate the same 184 lb-ft (250 Nm). Cargo model ranges go from a city-friendly 184 miles (296 km) to 256 miles (412 km) for the bigger battery option on the WLTP cycle. No matter which you choose, you can zip from 10 to 80 percent state of charge in half an hour on a 150 kW charger. Neither version is lightning quick; you won’t crack 0–62 mph (100 km/h) in less than 10 seconds, but that’s not what the PV5 is all about. Vans are mobile workplaces. They either get you to your destination so you can use tools in the back, or they help transport other people. Rarely, they’re used as campers. During the van’s development, Kia did some smart outsourcing. It knows it can make a good vehicle; it’s been doing that for years. But it isn’t an authority on how businesses use them for specific purposes, so it brought in the right partners—for example, working with Uber to help optimize the van for ride sharing. It also teamed up with Samsung to integrate connectivity tech to help businesses track and manage charging. A van for all trades Note the AC power socket on the wall.

Kia The entry point at the rear is as low as possible. Kia This segment isn’t one that generally appeals to both sides of the work/life fence. Ford’s Transit can serve as a minibus, but in the UK, it’s primarily a commercial vehicle. VW’s ID Buzz can be used commercially as well, but it mostly wants to be a fun EV for big families. The PV5 needs to be both, and you can spec it as either, or a blend of the two. It also needs to avoid looking like a traditional van. Thankfully, Kia’s designers have made it look less like a box on wheels and more like something you’d spot on a futuristic movie set (sadly, it doesn’t hover). Two-tone paint options, a wild light signature, and thoughtfully placed curves keep it from looking like every other van. It’s… cool? If you opt for the cargo-focused version, which is what Ars tested on the UK launch, you get up to 155.4 cubic feet (4,400 L) of load space. It can accommodate 1,742 lbs (790 kg) of cargo with the smaller battery or 1,521 lbs (690 kg) with the larger pack. The load lip is 16.5 inches (420 mm) off the ground, making it much easier to load heavy cargo. Not luxurious, but build quality is solid. Kia Not luxurious, but build quality is solid.

Passengers get plenty of space to put their rolled-up newspapers, fast-food detritus, and other paraphernalia, as well as a pretty massive window to lean out of should the mood take them. The driver gets a hefty 7.5-inch digital instrument binnacle alongside a 12.9-inch infotainment display. Nearly everything is run through that screen, which is sad for those of us who want a return to physical buttons. It’s quick and responsive, but it lacks the haptic feedback that confirms a tap. The infotainment system supports Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, so you don’t have to use it too much if you don’t like it. On the road, delivering a load Even with 600 lbs (272 kg) loaded in the back—Kia wanted us to have a proper experience—the van felt remarkably car-like. The steering is smooth, and it has a delightfully tight turning circle to help navigate small towns and sharp city bends. It felt sure-footed and stable, though the ride was a touch on the jiggly side on all but the smoothest roads. Yes, it’s a van, so don’t expect a buttery-smooth ride, but because everything else is so car-like, you don’t expect quite so agricultural a ride. Nor do you expect the cabin to sound so echo-y. That contrast strikes you from time to time: it’s clearly built to do a job, but it’s also thoughtfully designed. Its touchpoints are designed to withstand heavy use, so while they’re not especially luxurious, they should hold up to the many painty/muddy/gunky hands that will use them. The powertrain is smooth, the ride a bit less so. Credit: Kia The powertrain is smooth, the ride a bit less so. Credit: Kia Its powertrain feels exactly as you’d expect from Kia: silky smooth. It’s not the quickest vehicle in the world, but its torque gets you up to speed briskly enough. Kia’s claimed WLTP figure of 3.8 miles/kWh (16.4 kWh/100 km) wasn’t quite achievable on a chilly day, but winter weather will inevitably knock those numbers down a bit. You can tell the PV5 isn’t the result of a simple “we have a powertrain, so let’s make a van” situation. Real thought has gone into how it will be used, how operators will interact with it, and how to make their lives easier. Ford, VW, Stellantis, and other van makers in Europe should take note. As for America, never say never. In the UK and Europe, the PV5 costs tens of thousands less than VW’s retro microbus, suggesting that a North American PV5 could avoid the sticker shock that slowed VW’s sales, leading VW of America to delay imports for a model year. Kia America hasn’t announced plans to import the PV5 yet, but Car and Driver recently spotted one testing US-specific modifications on roads near its office. 129 Comments"

The so-called century bond will form part of a debut sterling issuance this week by Google’s parent company, said people familiar with the matter. Alphabet was also selling $20 billion of dollar bonds on Monday and lining up a Swiss franc bond sale, the people said. The dollar portion of the deal was upsized from $15 billion because of strong demand, they added. Century bonds—long-term borrowing at its most extreme—are highly unusual, although a flurry was sold during the period of very low interest rates that followed the financial crisis, including by governments such as Austria and Argentina. The University of Oxford, EDF, and the Wellcome Trust—the most recent in 2018—are the only issuers to have tapped the sterling century market. Such sales are even rarer in the tech sector, with most of the industry’s biggest groups issuing up to 40 years, although IBM sold a 100-year bond in 1996. A banker familiar with Alphabet’s transaction said the company’s multi-currency bond offering is an effort to expand the investor pool given the massive amount of capital needed by Big Tech companies. “There might be a supply-demand imbalance if you were to try to come back to the US dollar market over and over again,” the banker said. Issuing a century bond in the sterling market is more cost-effective than in the dollar market, where the interest rate is higher, the banker added. While a century bond is “highly unusual” for tech companies, it could appeal to buyers such as life insurance companies and pension funds, which have a mandate to buy long-term assets, said Nicholas Elfner, co-head of research at Breckinridge Capital Advisors. Tony Trzcinka, a US-based senior portfolio manager at Impax Asset Management, which purchased Alphabet’s bonds last year, said he skipped Monday’s offering because of insufficient yields and concerns about overexposure to companies with complex financial obligations tied to AI investments. “It wasn’t worth it to swap into new ones,” Trzcinka said. “We’ve been very conscious of our exposure to these hyperscalers and their capex budgets.” Big Tech companies and their suppliers are expected to invest almost $700 billion in AI infrastructure this year and are increasingly turning to the debt markets to finance the giant data center build-out. Alphabet in November sold $17.5 billion of bonds in the US including a 50-year bond—the longest-dated dollar bond sold by a tech group last year—and raised €6.5 billion on European markets. Oracle last week raised $25 billion from a bond sale that attracted more than $125 billion of orders. Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta all increased their capital expenditure plans during their most recent earnings reports, prompting questions about whether they will be able to fund the unprecedented spending spree from their cash flows alone. Last week, Google’s parent company reported annual sales that topped $400 billion for the first time, beating investors’ expectations for revenues and profits in the most recent quarter. It said it planned to spend as much as $185 billion on capex this year, roughly double last year’s total, to capitalize on booming demand for its Gemini AI assistant. Alphabet’s long-term debt jumped to $46.5 billion in 2025, up more than four times the previous year, though it held cash and equivalents of $126.8 billion at the year-end. Investor demand was the strongest on the shortest portion of Monday’s deal, with a three-year offering pricing at only 0.27 percentage points above US Treasuries, versus 0.6 percentage points during initial price discussions, said people familiar with the deal. The longest portion of the offering, a 40-year bond, is expected to yield 0.95 percentage points over US Treasuries, down from 1.2 percentage points during initial talks, the people said. Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, and JPMorgan are the bookrunners on the bond sales across three currencies. All three declined to comment or did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Written by Elyse Betters Picaro, Senior Contributing EditorSenior Contributing Editor Feb. 10, 2026 at 5:56 a.m. PT Maria Diaz/ZDNETFollow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.Did you know Roku has several secret menus you can access with just a few clicks of the remote? They're like easter eggs -- hidden screens that can reveal diagnostic information, advanced toggles, and developer tools you never knew you wanted (or needed).You can do a \"soft\" reset with these menus, see a log of every remote button press since your last power cycle, find out the exact build of Netflix, Disney+, or Peacock you're running, check out your CPU temperature, or run a TV input test or AP speed test. Also: This 30-second fix made my Roku TV run like new again (and why it works)Sure, most of you may be perfectly happy never using these options on your Roku streaming device, but if you consider yourself a bit of a techie, or maybe you just like pressing buttons to see what happens, these secret menus are downright fun to try. How to find Roku's secret menus What you'll need: A Roku device and a Roku remote. If you don't have the physical remote on hand, use the one in the Roku app. 1. Developer settings Press: Home × 3 > Up × 2 > Right > Left > Right > Left > Right The Developer settings menu is where developers can test their apps on a Roku device before launching them. So, if you're a developer, think of this as your personal dev playground. Here, you can enable the Development Application Installer, sideload one test channel, and even manage your rokudev account. To access it, hit Home three times on your remote, press the Up button twice, and then tap Right, Left, Right, Left, Right. Show more Elyse Betters Picaro / ZDNET 2. Network menu Press: Home × 5 > Right > Left > Right > Left > Right The Network menu isn't exactly secret, but Roku still gives you a slick remote shortcut to access it. Also: I changed 6 settings on my Roku TV to give it an instant performance boostNeed your IP and MAC addresses or want to check your internet connection? That's what this screen is for on your Roku. Just tap Home five times on your remote and then Right, Left, Right, Left, Right to get to it instantly. From this screen you can also view or join networks and even toggle a bandwidth-saver mode. Show more Elyse Betters Picaro / ZDNET 3. Wireless secret screen Press: Home × 5 > Up > Down > Up > Down > Up Here's where things truly start to get \"secret\" -- heck, it's even in the name.The Wireless secret screen on your Roku shows information like signal-strength bars, antenna info, glitch rates, and on-device logs. You can run an AP speed test or purge your Wi-Fi settings, too. If your stream keeps stuttering, this should be your first stop. Just press Home five times and then tap Up, Down, Up, Down, Up. Show more Elyse Betters Picaro / ZDNET 4. Reset and update ('Secret screen') Press: Home × 5 > Fast Forward × 3 > Rewind × 2 You can do a factory reset the normal way under Settings. Or you could use a secret menu.Also: The best Roku TVs: Expert tested and recommendedOn your remote, press Home five times, Fast Forward three times, and then Rewind two times. This will get you to the Reset and update menu (also called \"Secret Screen\") that has options for a factory reset and refresh -- including a soft reset. You can also search for firmware and software updates, run USB port tests, and more. Handy if your Roku is acting up -- and you're too impatient to use the regular Settings menu. Show more Elyse Betters Picaro / ZDNET 5. Ads and screenshots ('Secret screen 2') Press: Home × 5 > Up > Right > Down > Left > Up Once upon a time, this menu let you disable screensaver ads entirely. Nowadays, it's more about giving you control over scrollable ads and screenshot output formats. Officially called the \"Secret screen 2\" menu, it has options like cycle image service, cycle screenshot output format, cycle home screen ad banner server, cycle ad channel, etc. To access this screen, tap the Home button on your remote five times, followed Up, Right, Down, Left, Up. Show more Elyse Betters Picaro / ZDNET 6. HDMI secret screen Press: Home × 5 > Down > Left > Up × 3 Want to know which resolutions, refresh rates, and HDR features your Roku device actually supports? Also: Is your Roku TV spying on you? Probably, but here's how to put an end to itThis is the place to go if you want to access all your HDMI settings. In the HDMI menu, you'll also find options to switch inputs or run a TV input test. To access it, press the Home button on your remote, followed by Down, Left, Up, Up, Up. Show more Elyse Betters Picaro / ZDNET 7. Platform secret screen Press: Home × 5 > Fast Forward > Play/Pause > Rewind > Play/Pause > Fast Forward Your Roku displays granular performance data like CPU temperature and voltage, memory usage, connected remotes and battery levels, and your SSID in the Platform menu. Even better, this screen is a hub for additional submenus: RF remote diagnostics, IPv6 settings, and a log of every remote button press since your last power cycle. Intense, right? To get to it, tap the Home button on your remote five times, then Fast Forward, Play/Pause, Rewind, Play/Pause, Fast Forward. Show more Elyse Betters Picaro / ZDNET 8. Channel info menu Press: Home × 3 > Up × 2 > Left > Right > Left > Right > Left Ever wondered which exact build of Netflix, Disney+, or Peacock you're running? Also: Roku vs Fire Stick: Which one is best for your streaming needs?This menu lists every installed channel with version and build-number details. Highlight one and you can uninstall on the spot -- perfect for troubleshooting or when you want to boot a misbehaving app. Show more Elyse Betters Picaro / ZDNET 9. Reboot shortcut Press: Home × 5 > Up > Rewind × 2 > Fast Forward × 2 Want to do a quick restart? Press the Home button five times, then Up, Rewind twice, and Fast Forward two times. No menus, no waiting. Your remote will lock up for a moment, but then your Roku will reboot. Show more FAQ How fast do I need to enter these button sequences? Pretty fast. If you take a moment too long between button presses, your Roku won't bring up the secret menu you're trying to access. If it doesn't work on the first try, just take a second to breathe and try again. Also: How to reset your Roku: 4 easy ways Can I find these Roku menus without pressing button sequences? Some menus are available in Roku's settings -- like the Network menu. But most of them are buried and only accessible by hitting the right button combo, as far as I can tell. Hence why some of the screens even have \"secret\" in their name. I lost my Roku remote. What can I do? Samesies. Luckily, though, Roku has a software remote available in its mobile app. Download and use that instead. Show more Featured Want local vibe coding?

Written by Steven Vaughan-Nichols, Senior Contributing EditorSenior Contributing Editor Feb. 10, 2026 at 5:28 a.m. PT Calvin Chan Wai Meng via Moment / Getty ImagesFollow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google. ZDNET's key takeaways Linux 6.19 is ready for deployment, while 7.0 is now in the works.This release boasts several performance boosts. The single biggest improvement is for clouds.Ring the bells, sound the trumpet, the Linux 6.19 kernel has arrived. Linus Torvalds announced that \"6.19 is out as expected -- just as the US prepares to come to a complete standstill later today, watching the latest batch of televised commercials.\" Because while the big news in Linux circles might be a new Linux release, Torvalds recognizes that for many people, the \"big news [was] some random sporting event.\"American football, what can you do? Getting back to what's really important, Torvalds described the final week of the cycle as uneventful, with no last‑minute surprises. This period of calm allowed the release to land on schedule and immediately open the merge window for the next kernel. Also: This is my favorite Linux distro of all time - and I've tried them allWith 6.19, the 6.x line ends on .19, mirroring the 3.x and 5.x series before the project increments to 4.0, 6.0, and now 7.0. Mind you, Torvalds confirmed that the next kernel after 6.19 will be branded Linux 7.0, not because of any major upgrades, but because \"I'm getting to the point where I'm being confused by large numbers (almost running out of fingers and toes again), so the next kernel is going to be called 7.0.\" What's included in Linux 6.19?What Linux 6.19 brings to the table is initial support for Intel's linear address‑space separation (LASS). This hardware feature is designed to enable operating systems to block side-channel security exploits, such as the infamous Meltdown and Spectre security holes. LASS achieves this block by more strictly isolating kernel and user memory to mitigate speculative execution and privilege‑escalation attacks. The release also adds support for Arm's Memory System Resource Partitioning and Monitoring (MPAM), giving system software more control and visibility over memory and cache usage on high‑end Arm platforms. Also: 5 Linux servers that let you ditch the public cloud and reclaim your privacy - for freeIn addition, the new kernel introduces a new listns() system call that lets userspace enumerate Linux namespaces directly. This capability is expected to be useful for container tooling and orchestration frameworks that need to inspect isolation boundaries. Linux 6.19 further reworks the restartable sequences implementation, a low‑level mechanism used by threading libraries to optimize per‑CPU operations, to improve robustness and performance under contention. For file systems, the popular Ext4 now supports larger block sizes and smarter handling of POSIX Access Control Lists (ACL) checks. This approach reduces unnecessary permission lookups in directories with many files. The net result can be up to 50% improvements in file reads. In real life, though, you're much more likely to see a far more modest speed boost. Also: Why even a US tech giant is launching 'sovereign support' for Europe nowKernel networking code also benefits from a redesigned transmit‑path locking scheme that replaces a busy lock with a lock‑less list in heavy transmission (TX) workloads. In theory, you can achieve a fourfold increase in network throughput. In practice, though, you'll also see that kind of speed boost in AI and machine learning clusters, not in your next World of Warcraft raid. On the desktop side, Linux 6.19 ships significant updates for AMD graphics. These updates include compatibility improvements for older Radeon HD 7000‑era GPUs via the modern AMDGPU driver stack and better Vulkan support through the open‑source RADV driver. Benchmarks from early testers show that some older AMD GPUs can achieve 30% to 40% performance gains on certain workloads compared with previous kernels. So, if you still have 2012 AMD graphics, you're in luck. You'll see a real speed boost. The release also incorporates expanded High Dynamic Range (HDR) support through the DRM color pipeline API. This capability enables hardware‑accelerated high‑dynamic‑range output on supported displays and GPUs. Also: My proven way to speed up Linux when RAM upgrades aren't worth it (and it's free to do)Beyond graphics, Linux 6.19 tightens integration with the latest Intel and AMD processors. This move continues the steady march of enablement work for RISC‑V and other emerging hardware architectures, reflecting the kernel's growing role in heterogeneous data center and embedded deployments. The real improvements in this release are for business and cloud administrators. The most important of these improvements is the Live Update Orchestrator (LUO). LUO is designed to coordinate kernel updates with minimal disruption to running virtual machines (VMs). It works by treating a live update as a controlled reboot into a new kernel. In other words, you can reboot your server while your VMs keep running. Instead of tearing everything down, LUO preserves the state of chosen userspace objects and critical devices, handing that state to the new kernel. While LUO is primarily designed for cloud and virtualization servers, where you want to update the hypervisor kernel without dropping running VMs or losing in‑memory state, it is explicitly workload‑agnostic. LUO can also be used for other high-uptime services. I expect LUO to be adopted quickly by most cloud providers. Linux 6.19 also adds encrypted communication between PCIe devices and VMs. This link strengthens defenses against snooping or tampering on the bus in multi‑tenant environments. Together with the new Intel memory isolation capabilities and Arm MPAM support, these changes underline a release that quietly leans into security and resource control. What comes next with Linux 7.0?Immediately after 6.19's debut, Torvalds opened the merge window for Linux 7.0 and noted that dozens of pull requests were already lined up and ready for review. Some work has already started on GPU drivers, expanded display support for Intel and Qualcomm platforms, broader sensor monitoring (including new Asus motherboard telemetry), and further refinements to virtualization and live‑update paths. Also: 5 of the easiest, quickest Linux distros to install - and I've tried them allDistributions are expected to begin integrating Linux 6.19 into development branches in the coming weeks, with some rolling‑release systems likely to pick it up first as vendors test the new kernel against their hardware stacks and userland tooling. The first Linux distro expected to ship the newest kernel is Fedora Rawhide, the distribution's development branch.

Close Home Home & Office Home Entertainment Speakers These wireless bookshelf speakers deliver gloriously smooth sound for any style of music The SVS Prime Wireless Pro offers rich, immersive sound that audiophiles will appreciate, and it looks great. Written by Jack Wallen, Contributing WriterContributing Writer Feb. 10, 2026 at 4:25 a.m. PT SVS Prime Wireless Pro ZDNET's key takeaways SVS Prime Wireless Pro powered speakers are available for around $899. You won't find a smoother, better-blended sound from an active speaker at this price point. To get the best bass, you should pair these with the SVS SB-1000 Pro subwoofer. View now at SvsoundView now at Best BuyView now at Amazon more buying choices Follow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.Most consumers believe punchy bass and sizzling highs are key to a good speaker. If that sounds like your taste, then you have a lot of options available for you (because a lot of manufacturers cater to booming bass). But the mark of a truly good speaker is the ability to blend the sound in such a way that you hear it as the artist intended. Instead of highlighting the low and high ends, you should aim to get a balance so you can hear all voices, instruments, and ranges coming together to form a perfect union.That's not to say you want a muddy sound (as a lot of low-end speakers will deliver). The goal is to create a sound field that allows each instrument or voice to shine when necessary (such as during a solo or a particularly important passage in a certain vocal range).Also: Update your Echo speakers ASAP for Alexa's most functional upgrade in decades - here's howI've experienced a lot of speakers that punch up certain frequency ranges because, well, that's what's popular. And certain musical genres inadvertently place those demands on manufacturers.But my aural happy place is when a pair of speakers delivers a buttery-smooth blend of sounds that don't force a particular range on me. Instead, I get to hear the music as the artist intended it. For many, such speakers are called \"Studio Monitors\" because they allow listeners to hear the truth in the sound.The SVS Prime Wireless Pro powered speakers delivered that very thing to me. And paired with my SVS SB-1000 Pro subwoofer, everything I threw at the setup was gloriously smooth. Hearing music through these speakers was like coming home. ZDNET Recommends SVS Prime Wireless Pro These speakers deliver some of the smoothest, best-blended sound I've heard at this price point. details View at Best Buy Best bluetooth speaker deals of the week Echo Spot Smart Speaker With Alexa (2024 Release, Black): $50 (save $30) Beats Pill Wireless Portable Bluetooth Speaker (Matte Black): $100 (save $50) Sonos Era 100 Wireless Alexa Enabled Smart Speaker (Black): $169 (save $30) Bang & Olufsen Beosound Explore Portable Bluetooth Speaker (Black): $199 (save $100) Deals are selected by the CNET Group commerce team, and may be unrelated to this article. Classical, choral, rock, prog, metal, classic rock…the genre didn't matter, as these speakers could handle it all.Of course, sound preference is a personal affair, but when you find a pair of speakers that can deliver a neutral sound, without lacking excitement, you know you have something special.Also: The best sound systems you can buy: Expert testedNote: The preset feature is used in combination with the mobile app that you can pair with the speakers. Although I installed the app, I didn't dive too deep into it because I didn't find it necessary.My experienceFirst off, I should mention that I have a unique setup. I listen to both my turntable and PC from the same speakers (I know, bad audiophile). The reason for this setup is that I listen to both while writing. Sometimes, I'll want to hear a piece of music from vinyl, and other times, I'll want to hear something I don't yet have on my medium of choice. And because my office (with cats roaming around) isn't exactly conducive to floor-mount speakers, I tend to go the bookshelf route.My previous speakers included both Aux and Line In inputs, which meant I could plug my Rega P8 turntable into one and my PC into the other.Also: I put away my subwoofer after trying this room-filling soundbar - and it looks greatThe SVS Prime Wireless Pro speakers have a single RCA Line In and a 3.5mm Line In. You can't plug both of those in and expect the speakers to know which device to prioritize. That's when I had to switch my PC to Bluetooth and connect my turntable to the RCA Line In.The only caveat is that my System76 Thelio disconnects the Bluetooth speakers every time the screen locks. So when I log back in, I have to reconnect the speakers via the Bluetooth manager. No big deal.Okay, on to the music. As I said, I ran these speakers through several genres. Here's a representation:Classical - Samuel Barber's Adagio For Strings - By far my favorite piece of classical music, the SVS Prime brought this heartbreaking piece to its fullest life. Every instrument could be picked out of the orchestra, and I was able to close my eyes and just let the smooth sounds wash over me. One very telling moment in this piece is the first movement's climax, where lesser speakers can distort at louder volumes. The SVS Primes handled it without a single crack.Choral - A Choral Christmas - There is no lovelier Christmas album, and this recording came to life with every instrument and voice blending with just enough space and depth to make me feel like I was in the concert hall listening to VOCES8.Classic Rock - Led Zeppelin's Kashmir - This was off the Mothership release, and I've never heard the song with such clarity.Progressive - Rush's Tom Sawyer - This is my go-to for testing speakers, and the SVS Prime gave the song the punch it deserves. Granted, I am using these speakers with the SVS subwoofer, but the kick you get from the very opening of the piece immediately brought a smile to my face. It's charged with power and just as agile as the musicians.Rock/metal - Band-Maid's YOLO - I love this song. From Kanami's near-virtuosity on guitar, Akane's pounding rhythms, Misa's phenomenal bass lines, Miku's rhythm guitar, and Saiki's voice, this song just fills the room with so much sound. And unlike my previous speakers, the song doesn't get lost in a kick-drum-and-throbbing-bass wall. Along with my testing tracks (all played on vinyl), I've spent the past two weeks listening to Christmas music (as I always do this time of year), and every song filled my heart with delight. ZDNET's buying adviceIf your current speakers sound too harsh or muddy, upgrading to a quality pair of active speakers can make a significant difference. After testing, I found the SVS Prime Wireless Pro to offer a well-balanced sound and a refined design, making it a standout choice at this price point. It's even better when you buy one on sale, which happens frequently nowadays.The specsThe specs for the SVS Prime Wireless Pro powered speakers look like this:Frequency response - 42Hz - 25kHz (+/- 3dB)Drivers - 1\" aluminum dome tweeter and 5.25\" mid-bass driverDual Class-D power amps200 watt (50 watt X 4) RMS powerDigital control tweeter-to-woofer crossover (2kHz (12dB/octave slope)2.36\" wide-flared rear-firing portDTS Play-Fi with lossless 192kHz/24-bit via Critical Listening Mode over Wi-FiCD quality for both Apple Airplay 2 and Chromecast for Android phones and devicesBluetooth 5.0 with AAC and aptXSpotify ConnectHDMI audio input supports ARC and eARCLeft/Right RCA input (input impedance 20K)3.5mm Aux input (input impedance 20K)Toslink Optical Input (S/PDIF receiver works at a range up to 96kHz)Ethernet connectivityUSB service portSubwoofer output - 2V max - auto-detecting low pass filter activates low pass at 80HzCabinet dimensions - 11.61\" (H) x 7.09\" (W) x 8.85\" (D)Weight - Active Speaker Weight 12.3 lbs (5.58kg), Passive Speaker Weight: 11.68 lbs (5.3kg)Included remote for switching between inputs, changing volume, and selecting presetsFeatured reviews I spent weeks with Alexa on the Echo Show 11, and it was awesome (until I started fact-checking) Sony LinkBuds Clip vs. Bose QuietComfort Open: This model wins big I replaced my bedroom TV with a $180 Roku projector - and don't regret it I found the Lenovo ThinkPad to rule them all - and its modular RAM changes everything I spent weeks with Alexa on the Echo Show 11, and it was awesome (until I started fact-checking) Sony LinkBuds Clip vs. Bose QuietComfort Open: This model wins big I replaced my bedroom TV with a $180 Roku projector - and don't regret it I found the Lenovo ThinkPad to rule them all - and its modular RAM changes everything Editorial standards Show Comments Log In to Comment Community Guidelines Related Finally, I found a Bluetooth speaker that pumps out loud sound (and looks good doing it) I changed 3 settings on my Sonos soundbar to instantly improve the audio performance How I upgraded my soundbar audio quality for free - and 4 other methods to give it a boost"

Close Home Home & Office Home Entertainment Speakers Finally, I found a Bluetooth speaker that pumps out loud sound (and looks good doing it) The Marshall Woburn 3 is a high-end Bluetooth speaker that both looks and sounds like a professional-grade amp. Written by Prakhar Khanna, Contributing WriterContributing Writer Feb. 10, 2026 at 4:21 a.m. PT Marshall Woburn 3 ZDNET's key takeaways The Woburn 3 is the most expensive home audio speaker from Marshall. It has fantastic sound quality, strong bass, and clear mids. However, the system only supports the SBC codec. $499.99 at Amazon$499.99 at Best Buy$399 at B&H Photo-Video more buying choices Follow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.The Marshall Woburn 3 commands a premium price, and while it's not the best value on specs alone, its rich, powerful sound and iconic design make it a standout for die-hard Marshall fans and audiophiles alike. If you've been considering the brand's flagship Bluetooth speaker, now might be the time to splurge -- discounts are rare, and any price drop makes it a far better deal than paying full retail. ZDNET RECOMMENDS Marshall Woburn 3 One of the latest speakers from the audio company features a stylish design and loud output. details View at Amazon Best bluetooth speaker deals of the week Echo Spot Smart Speaker With Alexa (2024 Release, Black): $50 (save $30) Beats Pill Wireless Portable Bluetooth Speaker (Matte Black): $100 (save $50) Sonos Era 100 Wireless Alexa Enabled Smart Speaker (Black): $169 (save $30) Bang & Olufsen Beosound Explore Portable Bluetooth Speaker (Black): $199 (save $100) Deals are selected by the CNET Group commerce team, and may be unrelated to this article. Timeless look and feel Prakhar Khanna/ZDNETThe Woburn 3 sports the signature Marshall look inspired by the company's old guitar amplifiers. At 7.5kg in weight and 12.5 x 15.8 x 8.0 inches in measurement, it's a big speaker. With its timeless look and feel, the Woburn 3 in Black would blend into any room decor. Also: The best soundbars of 2026: Expert tested and recommendedOn top, you get a faux leather finish with brass control knobs for Volume, Base, and Treble. They're accompanied by a power switch, a playback control slider knob, an aux port, and another button to switch between Bluetooth, aux, RCA, and HDMI inputs. The front is a cloth speaker grille with the company's branding, completing the classy, elegant look. Connectivity options include Bluetooth v5.2, HDMI, RCA, and a 3.5 mm jack. You also get a cavity on the back to make it easier to pick up and move the speaker when needed. Where it lacks in features, it makes up for in soundThe Marshall Woburn 3 isn't as feature-rich as some other speakers in this price range. There's no Wi-Fi or voice assistant support, and you miss out on AAC, AptX, LDAC, and other hi-res capable codecs. Marshall has put a lot of effort into the hardware but has done a poor job by limiting wireless source support. If you can look past it, the speaker does a fantastic job at what it's made for. Also: I put away my subwoofer after trying this room-filling soundbar - and it looks greatThe Woburn 3 features a 90 W Class D amplifier powering a 6-inch woofer, with dual 15 W amplifiers. Two 15W Class D amplifiers drive the two 0.75-inch tweeters. These are all highly capable drivers. Prakhar Khanna/ZDNETI had the treble and bass knobs set to neutral throughout my testing. The speaker delivers strong bass with the woofer's low-end power. It has a bass-forward DSP that delivers detail even at low volumes. You can feel the sub-bass thumps at 30% or higher volume. Go louder, and the bass stays clean and detailed.Also: Your LG TV is getting a big audio performance upgrade for free - including these OLED modelsYou'll enjoy listening to rock, punk, and heavy metal just as much as you do acoustic music. The drums feel headbanging-worthy, and the acoustic strums also sound bright and detailed. The vocals are clear, and the mids are detailed with sparkly highs. However, the higher frequencies tend to distort slightly at high volume. The sound signature is very enjoyable, and the speaker can fill a big room at 70% volume. If the physical controls are out of reach, the Woburn 3 can be paired with the Marshall Bluetooth app to adjust in-app EQ. You can also use the Placement Compensation feature to set the speaker at the best place in your room, and it'll adjust the sound accordingly. To get the most out of your speaker, you just need to answer two basic questions. ZDNET's buying adviceThe Marshall Woburn 3 isn't the best value for money -- it costs more than it offers. The drivers support hi-res codecs, but if you want a speaker for its performance and timeless aesthetic, the Marshall Woburn 3 is a great deal at $515.The big Marshall home speaker delivers strong, clean bass with a rumble, alongside bright highs and detailed mids. It's superb for big rooms. But if you want something smaller from Marshall, the Stanmore 3 is great too. You can get it for around $399, where the missing codec support is still formidable.Featured reviews I spent weeks with Alexa on the Echo Show 11, and it was awesome (until I started fact-checking) Sony LinkBuds Clip vs. Bose QuietComfort Open: This model wins big I replaced my bedroom TV with a $180 Roku projector - and don't regret it I found the Lenovo ThinkPad to rule them all - and its modular RAM changes everything I spent weeks with Alexa on the Echo Show 11, and it was awesome (until I started fact-checking) Sony LinkBuds Clip vs. Bose QuietComfort Open: This model wins big I replaced my bedroom TV with a $180 Roku projector - and don't regret it I found the Lenovo ThinkPad to rule them all - and its modular RAM changes everything Editorial standards Show Comments Log In to Comment Community Guidelines Related This Bluetooth speaker I tested delivers immersive sound at a price that's easy on the wallet I've yet to find a Bluetooth speaker that delivers more powerful bass and clearer mids than this How I upgraded my soundbar audio quality for free - and 4 other methods to give it a boost"

Written by Jack Wallen, Contributing WriterContributing Writer Feb. 10, 2026 at 4:15 a.m. PT Jack Wallen / Elyse Betters Picaro / ZDNETFollow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.I've been using Android since version 1.5, so it's rare for a feature to catch me off guard. You can imagine that when I do come across an unfamiliar Android feature, it's an exciting moment.For more casual (or newer) users of Google's mobile operating system, there are probably several hidden gems waiting to be discovered in Android, and some of these can be handy.Also: How to clear your Android phone cache (and say goodbye to slow performance)I've curated five somewhat hidden Android features that I believe every user should at least know about. Let's dive into those features.1. Share Wi-Fi via QR codeYou may not give this feature a second thought, but allow me to set a scene for you. Say you're having visitors for the holidays and want to grant them access to your Wi-Fi network. Instead of making the password public (so anyone can use it), you could share the Wi-Fi credentials via QR code. Not only does this approach simplify adding another device to the network, but it also does so with a nod to security. Open Settings > 'Network and Internet' > Internet, and tap the network you want to share. At the top of the resulting page, tap Share and verify it's you via biometrics or password/PIN.Also: My secret trick to easily share Wi-Fi passwords with guests (and why I can't go back)A new page will open with a QR code for the selected Wi-Fi network. Present the QR code to whoever you want to scan it with their phone, a process that automatically adds the network to their device. You could also screenshot the QR code, print it out, and make the printout available (so you don't have to hand your phone around for people to scan). Sharing Wi-Fi via QR Code makes the process so much easier. Screenshot by Jack Wallen/ZDNET2. Enable 'Developer options'Android's 'Developer options' menu isn't just for developers. Anyone can enable it and gain access to a host of features, some of which are very handy. With Developer options enabled, you can configure the maximum number of Bluetooth devices allowed to connect to your phone, unlock your bootloader, enable automatic system updates, enable USB debugging, edit the graphics driver settings, force peak refresh rate, and much more. Developer options should be enabled if you want power user-level control over Android. Also: How to factory reset your Android phone without unlocking it firstTo enable the feature, go to Settings > About Phone, scroll to the bottom of the page, and tap 'Build number' seven times. Once you've done that, you'll find 'Developer options' in Settings > System. Tap that entry to reveal the new options. You'll find tons of new configuration options here. Screenshot by Jack Wallen/ZDNET3. Text translationIf you're traveling outside your country, you might need help translating text. Fortunately, Android is quite capable of translating text via the camera app.This is an impressive feature. Let's say you have a menu or some other information you want translated. Unlock your Android phone and tap the Lens icon in the Search bar. Point your camera at what you want to translate and tap the Translate button.Also: 5 habit trackers on Android that can reveal your patterns - and motivate you to changeAndroid will automatically translate the text and display it as an image (almost exactly how it's laid out in the original document). You can then view the translated text, copy it to your computer, take a screenshot, or search for it. You could use this feature for just about any situation where you need text translated automatically.As a bonus, there's also the official Google Translate app, which can listen to voices and translate from one language to another. If you travel to countries where you don't speak the native language, this app should be a must-have. Translating the text from the Howl's Moving Castle soundtrack. On the left is the original, and on the right is the translated text. Screenshot by Jack Wallen/ZDNET4. Use Extend UnlockWhen at home, I don't need to lock my phone because I'm not concerned that someone will grab it and steal my information. Where physical threats to your phone are minimal, consider making access easier by enabling Extend Unlock (which used to be called Smart Lock) and adding your home as a Trusted Place. Also: How to start using the new Linux terminal on your Android deviceTo do this, go to Settings > 'Security & privacy' > 'More security & privacy' > Extend Unlock. You'll be prompted to verify that it's you and then be presented with a description of Extend Unlock. On the next page, you can configure Extend Unlock for on-body detection, trusted places, or trusted devices. Tap 'Trusted places' and, on the resulting page, add a new trusted place. Once you've done that step, whenever you arrive at your trusted place, your phone will be unlocked automatically until you leave that location.Note that this approach can lead to security issues, especially if you have guests in your home. With that in mind, use this feature judiciously. Use Extend Unlock with caution. Screenshot by Jack Wallen/ZDNET5. Set your medical informationAndroid allows you to store important medical information, such as name, height, weight, gender, blood type, date of birth, organ donor status, pregnancy status, medications, address, and medical notes. If you ever need this feature, you'll be glad you took advantage of it. To add your medical information, go to Settings > 'Safety & emergency' > 'Medical information'. On the next page, add whatever information you deem important. There are two caveats to this feature. First, emergency responders need to know about the feature to use it. Second, those same responders would have to be able to unlock your phone to access it. Also: The best SSH clients for Android - including my two favoritesTo get around that issue, tap 'Change setting' at the bottom and, on the resulting page, make the information available, even when your phone is locked, during an emergency call. To access this feature, tap Emergency at the bottom of the dial pad (for the unlock screen) and then tap View Emergency Information. Even with these hurdles, it's an important feature to have available should you need it. Add only the information you deem necessary for medical emergencies. Screenshot by Jack Wallen/ZDNET6. Gboard clipboardYou might not know this fact, but the Android keyboard (Gboard) has some impressive clipboard features. Once enabled, you can copy text and images (holding them on the clipboard for up to an hour before forgetting them), save and edit clips (so you can reuse them later), pin clips (by touching and holding them), and more. Also: I changed 12 settings on my Android phone to dramatically improve battery lifeYou have to enable the Gboard clipboard manually. Otherwise, Android will use the traditional, built-in clipboard. I much prefer the Gboard clipboard because of the extended features. You enable the clipboard by opening the keyboard (from within any app), tapping the clipboard icon, and then tapping the On/Off slider until it's in the On position. The Gboard clipboard is so much better than the default. Screenshot by Jack Wallen/ZDNETFeatured Want local vibe coding?

The move came after a group of Republican state attorneys general wrote a letter to complain about the document’s chapter on climate change, with one of the letter’s criticisms being that it treated human influence on climate as a fact. In response to the letter, the Federal Judicial Center has now deleted the entire chapter. The Federal Judicial Center has been established by statute as the “research and education agency of the judicial branch of the United States Government.” As part of that role, it prepares documents that can serve as reference material for judges unfamiliar with topics that find their way into the courtroom. Among those projects is the “Reference Manual on Scientific Evidence,” now in its fourth edition. Prepared in collaboration with the National Academies of Science, the document covers the process of science and specific topics that regularly appear before the courts, like statistical techniques, DNA-based identification, and chemical exposures. When initially released in December, the fourth edition included material on climate change prepared by two authors at Columbia University. But a group of attorneys general from Republican-leaning states objected to this content. At the end of January, they sent a letter to the leadership of the Federal Judicial Center outlining their issues. Many of them focus on the text that accepts the reality of human-driven climate change as a fact. “Nothing is ‘independent’ or ‘impartial’ in issuing a document on behalf of America’s judges declaring that only one preferred view is ‘within the boundaries of scientifically sound knowledge,’” the letter complains, while ignoring many topics where the document does exactly that. But the objections are only about one specific area of science: “The Fourth Edition places the judiciary firmly on one side of some of the most hotly disputed questions in current litigation: climate-related science and ‘attribution.’” In short, the state attorneys general object to the document treating facts as facts, as there have been lawsuits that contested them. “Among other things, the Manual states that human activities have ‘unequivocally warmed the climate,’ that it is ‘extremely likely’ human influence drives ocean warming, and that researchers are ‘virtually certain’ about ocean acidification,” their letter states, “treating contested litigation positions as settled fact.” In other words, they’re arguing that, if someone is ignorant enough to start a suit based on ignorance of well-established science, then the Federal Judicial Center should join them in their ignorance. The attorneys general also complain that the report calls the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change an “authoritative science body,” citing a conservative Canadian public policy think tank that disagreed with that assessment. These complaints were mixed in with some more potentially reasonable complaints about how the climate chapter gave specific suggestions on how to legally approach some issues, and assigned significance to one or two recent studies that haven’t yet been validated by follow-on work. But the letter’s authors would not settle for revisions based on a few reasonable complaints; instead, they demand the entire chapter be removed because it accurately reflects the status of climate science. Naturally, the Federal Judicial Center has agreed. We have confirmed that the current version of the document no longer includes a chapter on climate science, even though the foreword by Supreme Court Justice Elana Kagan still mentions it.

Close Home Tech Smartphones Mobile Accessories These Bluetooth trackers beat my AirTags in 2 meaningful ways (and work with Android) Rolling Square's AirCard Pro and AirNotch Pro will do most tracking work while offering useful design features. Written by Adrian Kingsley-Hughes, Senior Contributing EditorSenior Contributing Editor Feb. 10, 2026 at 4:14 a.m. PT Rolling Square AirCard Pro and AirNotch Pro ZDNET's key takeaways Both tags feature super loud 360-degree omnidirectional buzzers Both finder tags are super tough and built to last The tags have features you don't see on AirTags, such as wireless charging and glow-in-the-dark inserts. $18.99 at Amazon I love finder tags and have them on anything and everything I can possibly lose. They've made life so much better -- reducing frustration and eliminating those morning panics over finding my keys and wallet.While the Apple AirTag is undoubtedly the best of the best -- it's the only tag to offer precision finding -- plenty of third-party finder tags offer features that AirTags can't provide.Also: AirTag 2 vs. AirTag 1: I compared both Bluetooth trackers, and the winner is not so obviousOne company hitting it out of the park with finder tags is Rolling Square, whose two latest options are fantastic. First up is the AirCard Pro, a finder tag designed to be slid into a wallet or purse. According to Rolling Square, this is the world's first Bluetooth finder tag with wireless charging, Android and Apple compatibility, and an integrated digital ID feature. ZDNET RECOMMENDS Rolling Square AirCard Pro A finder tag that's compatible with Android and Apple Find My networks. details View at Amazon The tag measures 85.4 x 54 x 2.2 mm/3.4 x 2.2 x 0.09 inches -- thinner than two credit cards -- and weighs only 18 grams / 0.63 ounces. It's also built tough. It's constructed from two nearly unbreakable epoxy-fiberglass sheets that sandwich the electronics in a CNC-machined anodized aluminum frame. Inside this tiny package is a loud buzzer that can be heard almost anywhere. Super thin, yet tough! Adrian Kingsley-Hughes/ZDNET The AirCard Pro features an ultra-flat lithium 220mAh battery that provides 12 months of battery life, whether you're using it with an iPhone or an Android device (the black cards are for Apple's Find My network, and the white cards for Google's Find My Device network). When the battery goes flat, just pop the AirCard Pro on a wireless charger, and it'll be charged up in 90 minutes.Also: How to find out if an AirTag is tracking you - and what to do about itThe laser-etched QR code lets you create a Digital ID to which you can add your contact info, social media links, and any other personal data you want. You can share this ID by getting people to scan the QR code. If the worst happens and you lose your wallet, you can change the message to include information to help you get it back. The omnidirectional speaker is much louder than the speaker on the AirTag. Adrian Kingsley-Hughes/ZDNET Next is the AirNotch Pro, a finder tag for fitting onto keys. Again, this is another world's first for Rolling Square: a Bluetooth finder tag that is Android- and Apple-compatible (again, the black tags are for Apple's Find My network, and the white ones for Google's Find My Device network), with a replaceable battery and 360-degree omnidirectional sound.Also: I created the ultimate Wi-Fi password key with the most unexpected gadget - how it worksThese tags are also built to survive, made of tough ABS plastic, robust CNC-machined anodized aluminum, and custom gaskets -- providing IP68-rated dust- and water-resistance. Everything is held together with a dozen Torx screws.Embedded into the case are ultra-bright photoluminescent glow-in-the-dark inserts that help you find your items day or night -- a fantastic touch. Yes, it has glow-in-the-dark elements for easy finding in low-light conditions. Adrian Kingsley-Hughes/ZDNET The tags measure 54.8 x 27.6 x 10.2 mm/2.2 x 1.1 x 0.4 inches and weigh only 23 grams/0.35 ounces. Inside are two CR2032 replaceable button batteries, which will last 20 months before needing to be replaced. The AirNotch Pro also features two super-loud buzzers that emit omnidirectional 360-degree sound to help you locate your items. ZDNET's buying adviceI do like Rolling Square hardware. Everything the company makes that I've tested has exceeded my expectations (it also makes some excellent charging cables).Also: This smart luggage lock has effectively replaced the AirTag for me when travelingRolling Square products combine great engineering with tough construction; these tags are no exception. I love the handy little features, such as the super-loud buzzer -- Apple really needs a louder buzzer on the AirTags -- and the use of photoluminescent paint.The AirCard Pro and AirNotch Pro are both pricier than the AirTag, but they work on both Apple and Android networks, have more features, and are built to last.

Close Home Tech Services & Software Operating Systems Mobile OS Android Need a rugged Android tablet for your business? I tested one that looks great and lasts all day The Oukitel RT10 tablet is built like a tank yet still delivers a bright, vivid display at a fair price. Written by Jack Wallen, Contributing WriterContributing Writer Feb. 10, 2026 at 4:09 a.m. PT Oukitel RT10 tablet ZDNET's key takeaways The Oukitel RT10 tablet is on sale now for $429. This beefy tablet has respectable performance and unrivaled battery life. If you're looking for something light and delicate, look elsewhere. View now at Oukitel Follow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.For me, Oukitel is synonymous with ruggedness. Every product I've ever been sent from them is an exercise in durability. Just picking up one the brand's tablets or phones makes you realize how light and delicate other brands' devices actually are. The RT10 tablet is no exception. It's thick, heavy, and sturdy, but it's no gimmick. Also: I tested a 33,000mAh Android phone with a built-in projector for a week - here's my verdictYou might think these brawny devices would be a gimmick, but they actually serve an important purpose. Consider this: You take your delicate iPad out into the field (or camping, or anywhere that doesn't offer ideal conditions) and wind up having to carry it around as carefully as you might a newborn baby. ZDNET RECOMMENDS Oukitel RT10 Tablet This heavy-duty tablet can take a beating and continue running for days. details View at Oukitel The RT10 weighs in at a chonky 1255g. To put that into perspective, the 13-inch M4 iPad Pro weighs a scant 523g. Given the RT10 is an 11-inch tablet, the 11-inch version of the same iPad only weighs 444g. The RT10 weighs nearly three times the iPad. Of course, the iPad would shudder if you took it into the conditions the RT10 is built for. My experienceWith the form factor out of the way, let's talk about how I fared with the Oukitel RT10. After unboxing the tablet, I connected Android to my Google account and set up the usual features (fingerprint, etc). As with any Android device, it was incredibly easy.I then went about my usual testing. The first thing I do with tablets and phones is see how responsive the UI is. In the case of the RT10, the Android UI was a bit sluggish. Also: Why I'm recommending Google's Pixel Buds in 2026 (after years of passing on them)That aroused my curiosity. I decided to install a different homescreen launcher. To be specific, I went with O Launcher. Why did I do this? Primarily because O Launcher uses fewer system resources than most, I figured it might solve the tablet's sluggishness.Lo and behold, using O Launcher as my default solved that issue. Now the RT10 runs like an absolute champ.With speed no longer an issue, I put the tablet through the usual paces. Here are my conclusions:Display: It's quite crisp. I'd go so far as to say that this is the best tablet display Oukitel has produced.Sound: The speakers are capable of producing very loud sound. On top of that, it offers a pretty good amount of bass, preventing the sound from being too tinny (like so many tablets). This might be the best-sounding tablet I've tested.Performance: Once I installed O Launcher, the RT10 performed very well. Out of the box, however, it was a little sluggish.Battery: Good grief, the battery just keeps going and going. I set up the tablet and put it away for over a month. When I started it up again, there was still a 94% charge.OS: It's Android 15, but I've got no big gripes there.RAM: Out of the box, you get 16GB. Like all Oukitel devices, you can bump that up with what they call Memory Expansion. In all my time testing Oukitel devices, I've yet to see memory expansion have much impact on performance. This time, however, I noticed a slight bump after enabling the feature.Cameras: I was actually surprised by the quality of the pictures the cameras produced. Even the selfie camera wasn't too shabby. No, they aren't as good as the Pixel cameras, but they can hold their own. The Camera app also doesn't include a horde of AI features, so it's just point-and-click goodness. The Macro camera is pretty good, but don't think you're going to win any awards with it. Me and my goofy mug. Jack Wallen/ZDNETThe big issue some users might have is the weight. The RT10 is as heavy as a tablet can be. What you have to remember, however, is that's part of what makes Oukitel's products so unique. The RT10 is specifically made to thrive in tough conditions. Take this tablet to the beach, on a hike, to a construction site… it doesn't matter because it's got the oomph to stand up to just about anything you can throw at it.Also: The best rugged phones in 2026: Tested by expertsAnother thing I really appreciate about the Oukitel tablets is that most of them ship with a handy (and very sturdy) kickstand. The kickstand has to be attached, and it adds to the weight, but it's very much worth using. Gotta love these beefy kickstands. Jack Wallen/ZDNETYou also get a hand strap you can attach. Both of these accessories are attached by way of screws, so they are rock solid. Lastly, there's a carrying strap you can attach to the kickstand to make carrying the RT10 around easier.ZDNET's buying adviceThe Oukitel line of devices appeals to a certain cross-section of society. If you drive a Ford F150 to work and you come home caked in dirt or construction dust, this tablet is for you. If you're a hiker or camper, ditto. As well, if you want a tablet with an absolutely massive battery, you could do a whole lot worse than the RT10.If, on the other hand, you prefer a tablet that weighs nothing, looks like every other tablet being carried around, and you don't like Android, this tablet is most certainly not for you.Oukitel RT10 tablet specsDisplay: 11-inch IPS FHD+ 1200 x 1920 with a 120Hz refresh rate and 500 nits brightness.Processor: MediaTek Dimensity 7400X (4x 2.6 GHz Cortex-A78 + 4x 2.0 GHz Cortex-A55).Memory & Storage: 12GB LPDDR5 RAM (expandable up to 36GB) and 512GB UFS 3.0 internal storage, with support for up to 2TB expandable storage.Battery: 25,000mAh capacity with 33W fast charging and reverse charging capability.Cameras: 64MP main rear camera (OV64B40), 20MP Sony night vision camera, 5MP macro lens, and 32MP Samsung front camera.Ruggedization: IP68/IP69K water/dust resistance and MIL-STD-810H certification, surviving drops up to 1.5 meters.Connectivity: 5G, Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.4, NFC, and GPS.Audio & Ports: Dual 5W speakers (>130dB), USB-C, and pogo pin connector.OS: Android 15.Industry Version Features: Includes a 2D barcode scanner and a customizable fingerprint module for enterprise useFeatured reviews I spent weeks with Alexa on the Echo Show 11, and it was awesome (until I started fact-checking) Sony LinkBuds Clip vs. Bose QuietComfort Open: This model wins big I replaced my bedroom TV with a $180 Roku projector - and don't regret it I found the Lenovo ThinkPad to rule them all - and its modular RAM changes everything I spent weeks with Alexa on the Echo Show 11, and it was awesome (until I started fact-checking) Sony LinkBuds Clip vs. Bose QuietComfort Open: This model wins big I replaced my bedroom TV with a $180 Roku projector - and don't regret it I found the Lenovo ThinkPad to rule them all - and its modular RAM changes everything Editorial standards Show Comments Log In to Comment Community Guidelines Related We ran battery tests on 9 popular tablets - this model lasted the longest (and other surprise results) I lived with this 25-inch Android tablet for a week - and it went surprisingly well The tablet that replaced my iPad and Kindle got a worthy successor (and it's just as cheap)"

ZDNET's key takeaways If Windows is your preferred operating system, consider these open-source apps.There are numerous open-source apps available for almost any task.These are all free to install and use on Windows.I've been using open-source software for a very long time. In fact, the last time I didn't use open-source software, Bill Clinton was president of the US.Also: This 11-in-1 docking station is the office productivity gadget I didn't know I neededOpen-source software is available for nearly every operating system on the market, from desktops to phones, and I often find open-source apps are superior to their proprietary counterparts. If you're a Windows user, you don't have to remain locked into closed-source software, because there are so many alternatives from which you can choose. Let me introduce you to some of my favorites. 1. LibreOffice LibreOffice has been my go-to office suite since way back when it was a twinkle in the eye of StarOffice, and I haven't looked back since. LibreOffice includes all the tools you're used to in an office suite and even includes a database component (similar to MS Access). And with a customizable user interface, you can work with a modern UI or one that recalls the days of yore. Also: 6 ways LibreOffice is better than Google Docs for serious writing workLibreOffice is installed locally, so you don't have to worry about a third-party cloud service accessing your information. You can set LibreOffice to automatically save in the MS Office default formats, so collaborating with those using Microsoft's tool is a no-brainer. LibreOffice is free to download and install for Windows. 2. Flow Launcher Flow Launcher is a quick file search and app launcher for Windows. With Flow Launcher, you use a customizable hot key to launch the tool and then search for whatever it is you're looking for. You can open apps, search for files, and browse the internet with your default search engine. Flow Launcher includes themes, animations, and sounds, and even allows you to build your own customizations. There are also community-created plugins to extend the feature set. Also: Can't upgrade your Windows 10 PC? You have 5 days left - and 5 optionsFlow Launcher is free to download and install. 3. Duplicati Duplicati is a zero-trust backup solution that can back up from Windows (or any OS) to any destination you need. You can back up to Dropbox, Box, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, or Amazon Web Services, or to other machines on your LAN for greater privacy. Duplicati allows for scheduling and remote management, and it has a straightforward installation. Your backups are fully encrypted, and you can easily monitor them for real-time insights via a well-designed dashboard. Duplicati is free for personal use. 4. Nextcloud If you're tired of using Google or Microsoft's cloud-based offerings (especially out of fear that they are using your data to train LLMs), there's always Nextcloud, the open-source, locally run alternative to cloud services. Nextcloud includes everything you need for file storage, sharing, collaboration, communication, organization, and more. There's also an app store where you can install plugins to extend the feature set. Also: Your Windows PC has a secretly useful backup tool - here's how to access itYou can install and use Nextcloud on Windows for free and even install the Nextcloud Desktop client for even easier usage. 5. Franz If you use several messaging apps and services, you might want to consider Franz, which brings them all into a single, user-friendly GUI. Franz lets you add WhatsApp, Facebook, Messenger, Slack, Telegram, Google Calendar, Discord, LinkedIn, Trello, Office 365 Outlook, Google Keep, and more, so you don't have to switch back and forth between apps. You can add as many accounts as you want and easily switch between them without leaving the Franz UI. Also: 5 tools I trust to keep my online conversations private and anonymousFranz is free to install and use. 6. YAZB YAZB (aka YAZB Reborn) lets you create custom Windows top bars (similar to macOS) that display helpful system information, such as battery status, internet speeds, weather, and more -- all with a clean, minimal, elegant style. YAZB also gives you quick access to shutdown/restart controls, customizable themes/icons/layouts, and allows you to add as many helpful widgets as you need. 7. File Converter If you've ever needed to easily convert or compress a file in Windows, File Converter has your back. Using a right-click context menu entry (within the file manager), you can convert audio, video, images, and documents from one format to another. In the case of documents, you can convert nearly any format into a PDF. You can also compress files in the same way. Also: How to upgrade your 'incompatible' Windows 10 PC to Windows 11 - for freeThe only caveat is that to convert MS Office files, you'll need MS Office installed. You can customize the application order within the context menu and even add or remove presets. File Converter is free to install and use on Windows. 8. Bitwarden If you don't use a password manager, you should start immediately. If you need a password manager, you should place Bitwarden at the top of your list. Not only is Bitwarden open-source, but it's also one of the best password managers on the market. With every feature you'll need (including a web browser extension), Bitwarden can do more to help keep you protected by simplifying the process of using strong, unique passwords. This open-source password manager includes a password generator (that can do both passwords and pass phrases), Bitwarden Send (to send files and text safely), and more. Bitwarden can be installed and used for free on Windows. You might even consider purchasing a license, as it gives you more collaboration features, which can come in handy with a large family or organization. 9. AutoHotKey AutoHotKey is an automation scripting language for Windows that allows you to define hotkeys for both mouse and keyboard, remap keys or buttons, and more.

Super comfortable titanium and magnesium frame. Smart AI integration. Better battery. Wide prescription lens support. Optional R1 smart ring makes control simpler.TIREDSoftware stability remains an issue. Smart ring is an extra $249. Navigation needs a little finessing. The display is tricky to read in bright light.In the 19 months since Even Realities launched the G1, its first pair of smart glasses, the four-eyed tech landscape has evolved at a pace. Ray-Ban has sold more than 2 million Meta Glasses, Oakley has joined the fun, and CES 2026 was awash with options from companies including Lucyd, RayNeo, Xreal, and MemoMind.The Even G1 originally stood out partly because the glasses featured a brilliant heads-up display, but mostly because they only looked “smart” in the sartorial sense. They weren’t perfect, with glitchy controls and more software updates than Windows 98, but the potential was huge.Launched in November 2025, the new Even G2 smart glasses weigh just 1.26 ounces, boast a 75 percent larger display, and can also be controlled by the Even R1, the company's first-ever smart ring. I’ve been wearing one for a few months and have been astounded by the technology on show and impressed by the updates, but some of the first-gen woes remain.What’s New?Photograph: Julian ChokkattuThe Even G2 glasses don't look especially different from the original G1, which is a good thing, because they are still arguably the sharpest-looking smart glasses available. There’s still a choice of G2 A—a classic oval shape—and G2 B, with a rectangular frame, in gray, brown, and a new muted green colorway.Even Realities G2 Smart GlassesRating: 6/10$599 at Even RealitiesThey are around 0.28 ounces lighter than the original, thanks to the new combination of aerospace-grade magnesium alloy and titanium temples. It’s not a huge difference, but the profile is a touch slimmer too. As a result, they feel even more like a normal pair of glasses.Like its predecessor, there are no cameras or audio playback, with the company preferring to keep its tech discreet. Notifications, navigation cues, translations, and AI-assisted prompts appear briefly in your field of view, then disappear. Paired with the new R1 smart control ring, the system is designed to keep interaction subtle.Photograph: Julian ChokkattuThe display system has been upgraded, with Even HAO 2.0 (Holistic Adaptive Optics), which pairs micro-LED projectors and gradient waveguide optics with precision-engineered lenses to produce a display that’s roughly 75 percent larger and significantly sharper than the original. Look carefully at the lenses and you’ll see a faint rectangle in each eye. This is where the projector displays crisp green digital text. Brightness can be adjusted to a searing 1,200 nits, making the display easier to read in variable light. There's also a second menu screen that floats in front of the main notifications page.The G2 gains IP67 water and dust resistance, and prescription support has improved to cover −12.00 to +12.00 diopters. Given how thin the lenses are, this is an impressive feat of engineering. Battery life is also improved, up from 1.5 to two full days.Controls are better now, too, and the touch panel on the temple tips is more responsive, with a quick touch or slide. But the headline upgrade is the $249 R1 smart ring. This zirconia ceramic and medical-grade stainless steel ring serves as both a thumb controller for the G2 interface and a wellness tracker, letting users scroll, tap, and interact without touching the glasses while also capturing metrics like heart rate, steps, and sleep. It has the potential to be a powerful tool, mixing a bright but discreet heads-up display with equally clandestine control from the ring.Smart EyesAimed squarely at the business professional, the Even G2 is designed to make work life easier. The Teleprompt feature is superb if you want to add polish to your public speaking, and it’s made all the better thanks to the bigger display. Add text via the app, and the microphone follows along as you talk, bolding the words in real time. You pause, and it pauses.Even AI is the onboard virtual assistant—pulling information from a mix of Gemini, ChatGPT Perplexity, and Even LLM—that can help answer questions without reaching for your phone. Just say “Hey, Even!” and ask. As with the first generation, when this works well, it’s brilliant, and concise answers swiftly appear for me to read, and using the R1 ring, scrolling longer answers is intuitive too. Sadly, while the results are accurate, it can often take far too long to process and display them. It needs to be a fluid interaction, and it’s just not quite there yet.Even Realities G2 Smart GlassesRating: 6/10$599 at Even RealitiesThe Navigate widget has been updated, and both the map view and speed of directions are much clearer than before. As a cyclist, I have used this feature more than any other and found it reliable, although the always-on map display is irritating, and pop-up alerts would make for a better experience.Translation has also improved, with support for 33-plus languages, and translations appear faster and more fluent than before. It’s still hamstrung by being predominantly a one-way transaction, but you can now hand over your phone to the person you’re talking to, so both of you can see their speech translated and displayed. When Even Realities finally adds audio to future smart glasses—and it will—this will be a brilliant feature.Photograph: Chris HaslamThe biggest innovation comes in the form of Conversate, the company's AI-driven conversation assistant. Once activated, it listens to your conversation and processes speech in real time. It identifies key topics, terms, and questions as you talk, then displays contextual cues—such as explanations of concepts, definitions of technical words, basic biographies of people mentioned—on the heads-up display. It also generates a live transcript and a summary you can review later in the app. In practice, it works impressively well, and mentioning famous people, sports teams, and events in history did indeed bring up prompts and facts in real time. The transcription aspect is excellent too, with accurate summaries and suggestions.I had hoped it would turn me into a sports stats guru down the pub, secretly being able to recall long-since-retired soccer players and obscure nuggets of information. It’s not quite there yet, and at times it would lag behind the chat and become a hindrance rather than a help, but it did suggest a cure for a friend’s particularly painful hangover.Having information flash up on screen is handy, but I found reading and digesting this information, while maintaining a conversation, to be pretty difficult. I’d occasionally be caught staring off into the middle distance mid-chat. The display is easy to read in most instances, but changeable light, especially sunshine, and chaotic backgrounds don’t help. Walking also bounces the display—like an erratic autocue—so think twice before trying to impress on a walk-and-talk with the boss.Even Realities G2 Smart GlassesRating: 6/10$599 at Even RealitiesAnd then there are the ethical implications of Conversate. Unlike Meta’s smart glasses, there’s no visible indicator that a conversation is being recorded. Even Realities told me the audio isn’t saved, only the transcribed text, but it still feels like something you should ask permission for before switching it on. I can see the appeal of having AI quietly prompting you during a meeting or even a job interview if you’re brave, but that usefulness arguably depends on it being covert, which puts you on thin ice. At the same time, openly flagging that you’re using AI would rather defeat the point.App AffairScreenshotEven Realities via Chris HaslamThe payoff for having such “normal-looking\" glasses is that the Even G2 is wholly reliant on its app and a stable Bluetooth connection. Available for iOS and Android, the app, much like the heads-up display, is a stripped-back monochrome affair, with easily accessible modes.Navigation and setup are intuitive, and it’s easy to adjust settings, choose how the HUD appears in front of your eyes, enable notifications, and decide what you want on the main dashboard. You can choose from news outlets (including WIRED), plus calendar and stock information. It’s sparse, but if you need instant access to the Nikkei Index, you’re sorted.I like how minimal and easy to navigate the app is, but not the number of times I’ve had to reboot, upgrade, connect, and disconnect the glasses during testing. The pair I received was still in beta, so bugs are to be expected, but even after the official launch and rollout of the consumer-ready app, it remains a lottery as to whether the G2 glasses and R1 ring will work as smoothly as they should.Software stability was the biggest issue I had with the original G1 glasses, and I’m annoyed it hasn’t been resolved here. I’m fine with firmware updates, especially with emerging tech like this, but not being able to rely on the glasses when I need them is hugely frustrating.Bling RingSporting a touch-sensitive surface along one side, the Even R1 ring (a $249 optional addition) lets you tap, swipe, and hold with your thumb to navigate the glasses' interface. It’s a genuinely useful accessory that makes day-to-day use of the G2 far easier than tapping the temple tips. Aesthetically, it looks good, though the Even logo wouldn’t have been my first choice. It does at least serve a purpose, indicating the correct orientation so the touchpad is within reach.The ring makes a big difference to usability and interactivity. You can scroll subtly without touching the frames, making it easier to forget you’re wearing smart glasses at all. There is a learning curve, and if you absent-mindedly fidget with your fingers, as I do, you’ll open menus by accident. It does get easier and smoother with practice.The R1 also tracks your sleep, steps, and heart rate, which is a neat touch. It’s not as accurate as my Garmin smartwatch or Whoop band, and the information is presented in a more rudimentary way, but there’s potential if you haven’t already invested in a wearable.Even Realities G2 Smart GlassesRating: 6/10$599 at Even RealitiesBattery life is a respectable four days for the ring, and the charging stand is nice. It is an expensive add-on, pushing the total (before prescription lenses) to $848, but having used the glasses both with and without the R1 Ring, I think it is money well spent.Last LookPhotograph: Chris HaslamAs a glasses-wearing tech journalist, I really love the idea of the Even Realities G2. Having AI help with tricky conversations, translate languages, answer questions, keep me up to date with my messages and emails, diary dates, and news headlines, without relying on my phone, is a brilliant idea.The design and engineering that have gone into these smart glasses is seriously clever. Getting the lenses that thin, while increasing display size, improving the fit, and reducing the weight points to a time when this technology will be seamlessly integrated into our regular rims. The G2 feels like the future, and they can be genuinely useful day-to-day. The fact that they also feel like standard glasses just adds to the appeal. The company also plans to open the software to app developers for third-party apps, a smart move indeed.At $599, they’re a premium choice. It’s more than I would personally spend on a pair of glasses, no matter how “smart” they are, but if you’ve already bought the Rimowa luggage, the Mont Blanc fountain pen, and the Tom Ford suit, this won’t be an issue.So the screen has improved, the glasses are better in most ways from the first generation, and the use of AI has evolved nicely with Conversate. But the day-to-day enjoyment and experience of the Even R2 glasses and Even R1 ring is hampered by slow connections, signal dropouts, software glitches, and all too frequent updates. When it works, it works brilliantly, but a product like this, one aimed at the busiest of professionals, needs to be absolutely friction-free. The hardware is ready, the software just needs to catch up, and quickly, especially with the Meta Ray-Ban Display hot on their heels.Even Realities G2 Smart GlassesRating: 6/10$599 at Even Realities$599 at Even Realities"

Close Home Tech Smartphones 3 upgrades the Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra needs for me to take it seriously (as an S25 owner) The Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra looks like another incremental upgrade, and these rumored omissions have me concerned. Written by Prakhar Khanna, Contributing WriterContributing Writer Feb. 10, 2026 at 3:47 a.m. PT Reviewed by Elyse Betters Picaro Prakhar Khanna/ZDNETFollow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.The Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra was one of the most reliable phones launched last year. It had a big, sharp screen with a unique anti-reflective coating, powerful performance, and versatile cameras. However, I couldn't use it full-time because of an ergonomically poor design and an aging telephoto camera. Also: Samsung Unpacked 2026: 5 biggest rumors I'm seeing on Galaxy S26 Ultra, Buds 4 Pro, moreThere have been rumors pointing toward similar downsides for the Galaxy S26 Ultra. I'm concerned about Samsung's upcoming flagship phone. 1. Where's the telephoto camera upgrade? Kerry Wan/ZDNETAccording to ETNews, the Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra will have a 200MP primary camera, accompanied by a 50MP ultrawide lens, a 10MP 3x telephoto camera, and another 50MP 5x telephoto sensor. The 200MP camera is fully capable of shooting high-resolution images, but the 3x zoom camera is due for a big upgrade. Also: I changed 10 settings on my Samsung phone to significantly improve the user experienceSamsung has relied on the same sensor for 3x zoom capabilities for a couple of years now. It was weak last year, when Apple pushed the limits in videography with its 4x telephoto camera, and Chinese manufacturers had perfected portraits and macro shots with improved processing. If it is the same telephoto camera in 2026, it doesn't stand a chance against competitors. I hope Samsung updates the post-processing to improve the output from its 10MP sensor, but I'm not super optimistic. If the Galaxy S26 Ultra sticks with the same 3x telephoto camera, I'd advise more people to use the 200MP camera mode and crop photos later instead of zooming in on the viewfinder. 2. Please, just focus on the ergonomics Kerry Wan/ZDNETLast year, Samsung slashed the weight of its Galaxy S25 Ultra to 218 grams -- a big feat for a mainstream flagship phone, especially since none of the $1,000-plus phones from Apple or Google weigh less than 230 grams. Despite a lighter design, it was harder to use than the heavier Galaxy S24 Ultra, which wasn't too comfortable due to its sharp corners, and the Galaxy S23 Ultra before that. The on-paper weight can be misleading because an unergonomic design can render a phone difficult to use in day-to-day life. That is exactly what happened with the Galaxy S25 Ultra. Also: Why the Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra's biggest upgrade won't be its camera or processor for meSamsung gave its flagship phone a boxy design, which looks good, and I like it, but it forgot to taper the edges on each side. As a result, when you hold the phone, its sides dig into your palm. Both the Apple iPhone 17 Pro and Google Pixel 10 Pro XL do better in this regard. If the latest leaks are any indication, the Galaxy S26 Ultra could feature the same sharp, flat sides as before. According to a now-removed video shared by leaker Evan Blass, the upcoming Samsung phone could retain the boxy look with flat sides. It looks similar to the Galaxy S25 Ultra, and I cannot say for sure whether the edges on both sides have been tapered. If not, I will be disappointed because I need my phones to be comfortable to hold without adding a case. 3. I hope the S26 Ultra isn't more expensive Kerry Wan/ZDNETThe Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra is not guaranteed to get a price hike, but rumors are split on whether it is going to cost the same as its predecessor or be more expensive. Samsung could be facing pressure from component price hikes, but the Galaxy S25 Ultra already cost $1,300 at launch. Also: Own a Samsung phone? Changing these 7 settings will extend its battery life by hoursTo put things into perspective, $1,300 for the base version is more than Apple and Google's big flagship phones. While Samsung has doubled the storage to 512GB for the same price as part of launch offers, it is still in a tough spot. Modest upgrades, but new tech is promising Samsung recently teased a new display privacy feature debuting with the Galaxy S26 Ultra. There is no official name for the feature yet, but it is expected to be called Privacy Display -- and it could be a big deal for both regular consumers and business users. It could work similarly to a privacy screen protector, which prevents strangers from snooping on your private data in public. Also: If these Samsung Galaxy S26 rumors are true, I might finally put my Google Pixel loyalty to restThe Korean company is said to achieve this through pixel-level light control, adjusting its OLED emission so that light only shines toward the user when the display is viewed straight on. It won't reduce the phone's overall brightness or color depth, unlike a physical privacy screen protector. I am looking forward to it the most. If Samsung can make a comfortable-to-hold phone, the Galaxy S26 Ultra has a lot going for it, despite some modest upgrades on paper. Featured Want local vibe coding?

Decent camera. Long software support. Nice AMOLED screen. Day-long battery life. Expandable storage.TIREDFrustratingly slow performance. No headphone jack.“Camera failed.” That was the first time I tried to look at a photo I captured on Samsung's $200 Galaxy A17 5G smartphone. I've now spent more than two weeks using it as my primary phone, and I can't wait to switch to something else.Yes, it's $200, so expectations shouldn't be high, but I didn't have as frustrating an experience with the same-priced Motorola Moto G (2026) I tested a month prior, and I'd argue you're better off waiting for a $300 phone to go on sale for an overall richer experience. It's unfortunate because the Galaxy A17 5G does have some great qualities, but you can't trust it to be reliable.Low MemoryPhotograph: Julian ChokkattuThe biggest problem with the Galaxy A17 is performance—it's powered by Samsung's Exynos 1330 chipset, but you can more specifically lay the blame on the limited 4 GB of RAM. International versions of this phone come with 8 GB of RAM, and I daresay they perform better. Many of the performance woes happen when you try to do one too many things simultaneously.Samsung Galaxy A17 5GRating: 5/10$200 $180 at Amazon$200 $180 at Best Buy$200 at SamsungThe worst offender is the simple swipe up from the bottom to go home or to switch to a previous app. With gesture navigation turned on, the Galaxy A17 constantly thought I wanted to trigger Google's Circle to Search feature, which would cause the phone to freeze and stutter until it finally loaded the capability. It was so bad that I eventually had to turn Circle to Search off.Forget trying to multitask. I'd be filling out a form or reading a story in Google Chrome, but if I switched to another app and then came back to what I was doing, the Galaxy A17 would often refresh the entire app again, causing me to lose progress and start over.Even notifications came through slowly sometimes. When I'd try to log into a service and get a one-time password for security, the texts would never come through until I actually loaded up the Messages app. Notifications from Google Home for my security cameras came through at first, but over time, they became sporadic, and sometimes never arrived despite seeing them on my other devices. Sometimes when I hit “Delete” on email notifications, the notification just stayed there unchanged.Photograph: Julian ChokkattuEven without juggling various tasks, performance is sluggish in general. You'll wait a full second or two after swiping down on the home screen just to see your notification drawer. App launches take a beat, and scrolling through Instagram is choppy despite the 90-Hz screen refresh rate. A lightweight game like Pako Forever was also very stuttery; playable, but not very enjoyable.There are moments when performance is perfectly manageable—after all, I have used this phone for more than two weeks, and it's not at the bottom of a lake (yet). But those lag spikes make it very inconsistent, and if there was a moment when I really needed to do something quick on my phone, I wouldn't trust the A17 to handle it.Samsung Galaxy A17 5GRating: 5/10$200 $180 at Amazon$200 $180 at Best Buy$200 at SamsungMy benchmark scores aligned with my real-world assessment. The A17 ranked slightly higher than Motorola's $200 Moto G in single-core performance, but much lower in multi-core performance, indicating that the Motorola device generally has it beat when you're juggling multiple apps. That makes sense, because I do not recall having as frustrating an experience with the Moto G when I tested it a month ago. Don't get me wrong, that phone is also very slow and annoying to use, but I wasn't this flabbergasted.The Good BitsI haven't had any issues with the 6.7-inch AMOLED display—it gets bright enough in sunny conditions, and it's sharp enough. The single mono speaker is serviceable, though it's easy to block when holding the phone in landscape orientation. There's a microSD card slot to expand on the 128 GB of storage, the phone is IP54-rated to withstand rain, contactless payments have worked OK, and the fingerprint sensor is reliable. GPS has been fine, though Google Maps can sometimes glitch out, especially if you try to do something else while navigating.I've dropped the A17 a few times (less than 2-foot drops), and it has held up surprisingly well, so it gets an A+ for durability. If it matters to you, there is no headphone jack here (Motorola retains it on the Moto G). It's also great to see that this phone will receive six years of software updates, far better than anything Motorola offers at this price. There's a good amount of bloatware you'll want to remove, but the software experience is otherwise similar to other Samsung phones. If you're a fan of One UI, you'll feel at home here.Samsung has stuffed a 5,000-mAh cell here, but battery life is rather unremarkable. It lasts a full day with average to heavy use, but if you use the phone sparingly, then it'll easily stay alive through a second day. There's no wireless charging, unsurprising for a budget phone, but 25-watt wired charging means it's not terribly slow to recharge.1 / 8ChevronChevronPhotograph: Julian ChokkattuMain camera.Samsung Galaxy A17 5GRating: 5/10$200 $180 at Amazon$200 $180 at Best Buy$200 at SamsungThe main 50-MP camera is where Samsung beats its Motorola peer more decisively. When it finally loads and takes the picture (be patient), the images it spits out are decently detailed and not too oversaturated. Things take a turn for the worse in low light, with significantly more grain and loss of detail in darker areas. Moving subjects in low light? Just forget about it. Overall, though, it's a passable camera. Just don't bother with the 5-MP ultrawide or 2-MP macro.If your budget is strictly limited to $200, I would buy the Moto G 2026 over the A17, even with its inferior screen and lackluster two-year Android OS upgrade policy; the Motorola looks much nicer and simply performs better. But I urge you to save just a little bit more cash. The smarter move is to be patient and wait for $300 smartphones, like the Moto G Power 2026, to inevitably go on sale. In a few months, expect it to dip below $250. Samsung will also likely release a $300 Galaxy A27—succeeding the Galaxy A26 from 2025—in a few months, and it will be a better buy if you can wait for a sale.Or you could just buy used and save yourself the frustration. Swappa, for example, has the Galaxy S23—just two generations behind—unlocked in good condition for $236. That's a flagship smartphone from 2023, meaning it'll deliver significantly better performance, not to mention a great camera system. Yes, the Galaxy A17 is a usable $200 smartphone, but do you really want something that's going to annoy you every single day?Samsung Galaxy A17 5GRating: 5/10$200 $180 at Amazon$200 $180 at Best Buy$200 at Samsung$200 $180 at Amazon$200 $180 at Best Buy$200 at Samsung"

Close Home Tech Services & Software Operating Systems Windows Your Windows PC has a secretly useful backup tool - here's how to access it Looking for a traditional yet flexible program to back up your personal files? Windows has a built-in tool you can use.

For that, you can turn to a variety of programs. But Windows itself has a built-in backup tool that's simple and flexible. The catch is that you probably don't even know it exists.Named simply Windows Backup, this feature lets you choose which folders and files to back up. You can back up only select files or all your Windows folders. You're supposed to be able to include an entire system image in the backup in case you ever need to restore Windows in full. Also: How to upgrade an 'incompatible' Windows 10 PC to Windows 11 - 2 free optionsThe limitation here is that you can't save the system image on removable media. But you can always use the system image tool to do this separately. Further, you can save the backup to a recordable CD or DVD, an external hard drive, or a network location. You can also set the backup to run regularly. The tool works the same in Windows 10 and 11. Is there a catch?But as always, there is a hiccup here. This version of Windows Backup has since been deprecated by Microsoft, which means it's no longer supported or updated. As a result, you may encounter issues or errors when using the tool. In my experience, it generally works reliably. However, the last few times I tried using a network share as my backup destination, I received an error that the specified network location cannot be used. Although I confirmed that the network path, credentials, and other settings were correct, I still received the same error. I've seen posts from other Windows users complaining of the same problem. Your mileage may vary, but keep this in mind when choosing your backup destination. Also: Your Windows 11 PC has a secret emergency shutdown feature - here's how to use itTo add to the mystery, Microsoft offers a newer tool also known as Windows Backup. (Yes, Microsoft loves to use the same names across different products to confuse people.) The newer Windows Backup is designed to back up and restore certain files and settings. The main objective is to help you move from one PC to another. In contrast, the older legacy Windows Backup that I'm covering here operates more like traditional backup software. Both tools serve their purpose. But here's how the older, legacy Windows Backup works and how to use it to back up anything you want, to any location you want. 1. Prepare your destination media First, you'll want to set up the media for storing the backup. For this, you can choose a CD or DVD, an external USB drive, or a network share. I typically use an external drive. Make sure the media is connected and has enough space. Depending on the number of files and the size of the backup, you'll want at least 16GB to 32GB of storage.

In the right pane of the Backup and Restore window, click the link for \"Set up backup.\"Also: 4 Linux distros that make Hyprland easy to try - and one is truly glorious Show more Screenshot by Lance Whitney/ZDNET 3. Choose an external drive If you wish to use an external USB drive, select the appropriate one at the next screen. Click Next. Show more Screenshot by Lance Whitney/ZDNET 4. Choose a network location If you want to attempt to store the backup on a network share, click the button for \"Save on a network.\" Type the name of your NAS or network drive and click Browse. You'll be prompted to enter your username and password for the network. From the dropdown menu, select the share name and folder in which you want to save the backup. Click OK. Enter your username and password in the Network credentials section. Click OK again to proceed.Also: After 30 years with Linux, I switched it for Windows 11 - and found 9 serious problemsAs I said before, trying to use a network share as the backup location triggers an error on my end. That's one reason I always use an external drive at this point. Show more Screenshot by Lance Whitney/ZDNET 5. Decide what to back up At the next screen, you can opt to let Windows select which files to back up. In that case, the backup will include the folders and files in your libraries, the ones on your desktop, and the default locations under your user profile. Otherwise, you can choose which folders and files you want to back up. I typically select the option to let me choose. Make your selection and click Next. Show more Screenshot by Lance Whitney/ZDNET 6. Select the folders to include in the backup If you opted to let Windows choose, the default locations are checked for backup. Otherwise, drill down through the tree and select the folders you want to include in the backup.

Schedule the backup At the next screen, set the schedule at which you want the backup to start.

When ready, click OK. Show more Screenshot by Lance Whitney/ZDNET 8. Review the settings At the regular screen, review the folders to be included and the schedule. If you need to make any changes, click the back arrow at the top to return to any previous screens. Otherwise, click the button for \"Save settings and run backup.\" The initial screen will indicate that your backup is in progress.

Return to the Backup and Restore (Windows 7) window and click the button at the bottom for \"Restore my files.\" Show more Screenshot by Lance Whitney/ZDNET 10. Look for the files At the next screen, click Search if you know the full or partial name of the files you wish to restore. Otherwise, click \"Browse for files\" to browse among all the backed-up files and select specific files, or \"Browse for folders\" to check out all the backed-up folders and select a specific folder. Drill down through the backup until you find the location of the backed-up folders or files. Select the files you want to restore and click the Add files button.Also: How to clear the cache on your Windows 11 PC (and why it greatly improves performance) Show more Screenshot by Lance Whitney/ZDNET 11.

Close Home Tech Computing Laptops How much RAM do you really need in 2026? A Windows and Mac expert explains Considering a PC upgrade, but unsure about how much RAM to buy? Here's what a tech expert recommends. Written by Cesar Cadenas, Staff WriterStaff Writer Feb. 10, 2026 at 2:01 a.m. PT Reviewed by Kyle Kucharski Cesar Cadenas/ZDNETFollow ZDNET: Add us as a preferred source on Google.ZDNET's key takeawaysRAM allows computers to run fast and optimally.16GB is now the standard for PCs and laptops.Heavy users may need more RAM. Know when to upgrade.I used to struggle when shopping for a new computer -- there's a lot to keep in mind. Over time, I learned to narrow it down to what I call the \"performance trifecta\" -- three main components you should be mindful of: processor, storage drive, and RAM. A good processor is the brain of the computer, and a lot of local storage means you'll have plenty of room for all your files.Also: RAM prices are ridiculous in 2026 - here's how my PC buying advice is changing this yearBut what about memory? It's a component many people fully understand (I was certainly a part of this group). RAM, or random access memory, is essentially a computer's short-term memory. Instead of saving data directly onto an SSD, the computer stores files temporarily in the RAM for quick access, resulting in faster performance. The higher the RAM (measured in Gigabytes, or GB), the more memory it has. There's a lot of information and differing opinions regarding RAM and how much you need on your computer. Should you opt for the laptop with the 32GB LPDDR5X RAM, or will 16GB be enough? I'm here to cut through all the fog and provide easy-to-understand advice on the amount of memory you should get. How much RAM do you need in 2026? Kyle Kucharski/ZDNETThe short answer: it depends on the operating system. For Windows machines, 16GB of RAM has become the operational minimum on new consumer laptops. Modern workloads have ramped up to such a degree that less RAM on a Windows device is fine, but it will limit you to everyday tasks like writing emails, internet browsing or watching YouTube videos. But let's be real here: the average worker is probably running dozens of tabs in their browser, a handful of apps in the background, and (possibly) generative AI, all of which demand memory power. In that sense, most people using their Windows laptops for work will want at least 16GB (for a value-driven, future-proof option) for a smooth user experience. Also: Skipping this PC maintenance step could cost you - here's the right way to clean your systemIf you're upgrading to Windows 11, Microsoft says the minimum requirements are 4GB of RAM, but I'd still recommend 16GB as the baseline standard. If you have more than that, even better, but for most PCs, Windows 11 should run about the same as older operating systems. Kyle Kucharski/ZDNETWhen it comes to MacBooks, things are a little bit different. Because Apple's machines are so optimized to handle daily workflows, 8GB of RAM goes a bit further than a stock laptop running Windows. In fact, it wasn't until fairly recently that Apple made 16GB the starting point with the new MacBook Air M4. MacBooks with 8GB are still solid machines for daily use, while more powerful models like the MacBook Pro and MacBook Pro Max offer substantial power with 24GB, 36GB, or more, making them some of the most powerful laptops on the market (and some of the priciest).Besides Windows and Macs, Chromebooks are a third category of consumer laptops that have seen a spike in popularity over the last few years due to their lower average price and lightweight operating system, ChromeOS.Also: My proven way to speed up Linux when RAM upgrades aren't worth it (and it's free to do)Because ChromeOS is so streamlined, Chromebooks can get along just fine with 8GB or even less, making them great machines for handling the basics like working out of the browser and having your Google Suite at your fingertips with snappy performance and a low price. The trade-off, however, is that you'll have less access to apps you'd otherwise find on Windows. All in all, it's true to say that the more memory you have, the better your computer should perform. But having too much RAM can also be a poor return on investment, because you end up spending money on a resource you hardly ever use to its full potential. It's like owning a big house but only using a few of the rooms. When buying a new laptop, I just recommend having a clear understanding of what you want to use it for -- that way, you can set realistic expectations about how much RAM you need. ZDNET RECOMMENDS M4 MacBook Air Apple's M4 MacBook Air raises the bar for ultraportable laptops with more default memory, better external display support, and higher overall performance. View at Best Buy ZDNET RECOMMENDS Lenovo Chromebook Plus 14 Lenovo's Chromebook Plus 14 brings an OLED display and marathon battery to the Chromebook line. View at Best Buy What does DDR5 mean? Kyle Kucharski/ZDNETSometimes, when shopping for a computer, you'll see the letters \"DDR\" followed by a number. This is an acronym that stands for \"double data rate.\" Without getting too deep into the weeds, DDR is a type of technology that improves the data transfer speed from RAM to other components, such as the processor. There have been five main DDR generations so far, with the latest and fastest standard being DDR5. Similar to 16GB of memory, DDR technology has effectively become the new standard for RAM as users demand faster speeds. There are also variations of the technology. A notable version is LPDDR5X, which stands for low-power double data rate 5X, a more energy-efficient version of DDR5 designed specifically for mobile devices. Don't expect DDR6 RAM to be released for a computer near you anytime soon. We saw the JEDEC (Joint Electron Device Engineering Council) announce the release of LPDDR6 back in early July. The JEDEC is the organization that established DDR as a computer standard. The technology is available for manufacturers to implement in their devices, but whether or not it'll happen -- or how soon -- is yet to be seen. When should you upgrade? Jason Hiner/ZDNET16GB is fine for most cases, but if you're a gamer or creative professional, you should consider 32GB of RAM. More RAM will ensure that the games you play and the video editing apps you use for work run more smoothly. I have that amount for my personal computer, and I'm very happy with that setup because I don't just write. Also: I recommend this older Windows 11 laptop over some newer models - here's whyI also play games on my desktop, edit photographs and videos, and run virtual machines, among other things. It's a heavy workload that requires the correct amount of resources to operate; even then, I am considering upgrading my PC to have more. It's not uncommon for me to see my workload take up over 70% of my computer's total RAM. I consider anything above 32GB of memory excessive unless you're a specific type of user. If you're editing 8K videos or running heavy apps simultaneously, then you'll probably need 48GB or 64GB of RAM. A good laptop that can deliver would be something like the M4 MacBook Pro or the Dell Premium 16. These are solid, top-of-the-line machines capable of tackling tough workloads. I'm not the only one who recommends 32GB for gaming. Back in November 2025, Microsoft published a handy guide on how to optimize your gaming PC setup, and the post includes a recommendation for how much memory you should have. And wouldn't you know it -- Microsoft recommends 32GB of RAM for users who play resource-demanding titles or mod-heavy games. ZDNET RECOMMENDS Dell Premium 16 Built for demanding workloads, the Dell Premium 16 is especially well-suited for creative tasks like graphic design and 3D modeling. View at Dell Why should you trust me? I've been writing about both software and consumer electronics for almost 10 years now, and in that time, I've worked in many different settings, from the traditional office to the home office, and even someone's backyard. The remote experience has made me extremely selective about what I choose to make my main computer, as I want to ensure the devices I use can handle my day-to-day tasks.
