The Complete tier, for example is 70 percent off, bringing the price of 24 months down to just $130.
NordVPN regularly appears on Engadget’s list of the best VPN services thanks to its wide server network, strong security tools and consistent performance across devices. NordVPN’s latest promotion puts one of its most comprehensive plans at a price that undercuts many competing premium VPN subscriptions.

The Complete tier includes full access to NordVPN’s core VPN service, which encrypts internet traffic and masks a user’s IP address to help protect online activity on public Wi-Fi networks and at home. Subscribers can use the service on multiple devices, including phones, tablets, laptops and smart TVs, with apps available for major operating systems. It also includes access to NordPass (more on that below), an ad blocker and 1TB of cloud storage. You’ll find similar discounts on all of NordVPN’s other plans: Basic, Plus and Prime.
Beyond the basics, NordVPN offers features like threat protection to help block malicious websites and trackers, as well as specialty servers designed for added privacy or faster performance in specific scenarios. In our NordVPN review, the service was praised for its evolving feature set and overall reliability, even as the VPN market becomes increasingly competitive. 
Engadget regularly tracks VPN pricing trends and this offer compares favorably with other current promotions. It also appears alongside NordVPN deals featured in Engadget’s ongoing roundup of the best VPN discounts available right now, which compares offers from multiple major providers.
Those looking for additional security tools may also want to note that NordVPN’s Complete plan bundles in extra services beyond the VPN itself. One of those is NordPass, the company’s password management app. NordPass is also discounted as part of a separate promotion, if you’re primarily looking for a password manager rather than a VPN. The Premium tier is currently 50 percent off, bringing the price down to $36 for two years. NordPass Premium adds features such as cross-device password syncing, secure password sharing and breach monitoring, which alerts users if stored credentials appear in known data leaks.
Both offers are available for a limited time, though Nord has not specified an end date for the promotion. If you’re still unsure whether NordVPN is right for you, it offers a 30-day money-back guarantee, so you can change your mind and get a full refund.

It's pretty much cable, proving you can't cut a cord if it's made out of invisible radio waves.
There are more than ten plans available and they are all cheaper than the typical asking price of $83 per month. There's a Sports Plan that costs $65 per month and includes channels like FS1, NBC Sports Network and all of the ESPN networks. Subscribers will pay $72 per month to add some news channels like CNN and CSPAN to the sports package.

The Entertainment Plan costs $55 per month and includes networks like Bravo, Comedy Central, FX and the Food Network, among many others. There's a beefier version of this that costs $70 per month and adds in family channels like the Cartoon Network and Nickelodeon, along with news channels.
Signing up for one of these plans still provides various perks of a standard YouTube TV subscription. These include unlimited DVR, multiview and the ability to add up to six members on one account. Of course, those with deep pockets can spring for some premium add-ons like HBO Max, 4K Plus and the NFL Sunday Ticket.

If you’ve got a device that still accepts microSD cards — whether it’s an older gaming handheld, the new Nintendo Switch 2, a dash cam, a drone or an Android tablet — we’ve scoured the market and put close to 20 top contenders through a number of benchmark tests. You can find our recommendations for the best microSD cards below, alongside some general shopping advice worth knowing before you buy.

Best microSD Express cards for the Nintendo Switch 2
 

 
 
 
 
Read our full guide to the best microSD Express cards for the Nintendo Switch 2
 
Let’s be clear about this: Unless you plan to own a Nintendo Switch 2 in the near future, you do not need a high-speed microSD Express card just yet. Nintendo’s gaming handheld is the only popular device that natively supports this standard right now, and microSD Express cards themselves are highly expensive compared to more traditional options.
 
Still, if you do want to increase a Switch 2’s storage, they’re your only choice. Fortunately, determining exactly which model to buy for the console is pretty straightforward: Get whichever one you can find in stock, in the capacity you want, at a price you can stomach.
 
We benchmarked several microSD Express cards for a separate Switch 2 guide, and for the most part, the performance differences between them weren’t great enough to justify paying extra for any particular model. Loading times weren’t quite identical with every test we ran, but the cards were extremely close in most games and common scenarios. The few times when there was a notable gap — fast-traveling to a particularly resource-heavy region in Cyberpunk 2077, for instance — the gulf between the slowest and fastest card was only ever about four or five seconds at most. That’s not nothing, but it’s also not something most people are likely to fret over unless they have a stopwatch handy.
 

 
 
  The SanDisk microSD Express Card and Lexar Play Pro.
 
 
 
The only time you’d notice a major speed difference is if you transfer games to your Express card from the Switch 2’s internal storage (and vice versa). In that case, the SanDisk microSD Express Card and Lexar Play Pro were generally the quickest, while PNY’s microSD Express Flash Memory Card had particularly slow write speeds.
 
Moving Mario Kart World to the SanDisk and Lexar models, for example, took around four minutes and 35 seconds on average; with the PNY card, it took a little over seven minutes. That said, the PNY model was the fastest when it came to moving games back to the system storage. Walmart’s Onn microSD Express Card was significantly slower to move games from the card to system storage, but it’s also the most affordable card we’ve seen by a good distance. Either way, most people aren’t constantly shuffling their games back and forth like this. Performance in actual games is more important, and in that regard the results were consistently much tighter.
 
What matters most is getting the most space for your budget. Unfortunately, stock for all microSD Express cards has been spotty since the Switch 2’s launch. For your convenience, we’ll list out all of the models we’ve tested thus far and their respective list prices below. Note that some lower-capacity versions — the 128GB SanDisk card, for one — advertise slower speeds than their more spacious counterparts.
 
 
 
SanDisk microSD Express Card: 128GB ($64), 256GB ($78), 512GB ($128)
 
 
Lexar Play Pro: 256GB ($60), 512GB ($120), 1TB ($220)
 
 
PNY microSD Express Flash Memory Card: 128GB ($48), 256GB ($62), 512GB ($124)
 
 
Samsung microSD Express Card for Nintendo Switch 2: 256GB ($60)
 
 
Samsung P9 Express: 256GB ($55), 512GB ($100)
 
 
GameStop Express microSD Card for Nintendo Switch 2: 256GB ($60), 512GB ($100), 1TB ($190)
 
 
Walmart Onn microSDXC Express Card: 256GB ($47), 512GB ($85)
 
 

 
 
  The Lexar Play Pro on top of Lexar's RW540 microSD Express card reader.
 
 
 
Broadly speaking, we recommend getting at least 256GB of storage, as Switch 2 games tend to have much larger file sizes than games for Nintendo’s previous handheld. But we also recommend holding off upgrading for as long as you can, if only because all of these cards should (tariff shenanigans aside) come down in price as time goes on.
 
There’s no point in buying a microSD Express card for anything besides the Switch 2, but we did run the models above through our usual PC benchmarks as well. Unsurprisingly, they are miles faster than any traditional card on the market.
 
With the 256GB SanDisk card, for instance, sequential read speeds checked in just under 900 MB/s in CrystalDiskMark and ATTO, while sequential writes topped out around 650 MB/s. Sustained writes speeds were slower (around 210 MB/s), but that was still fast enough to move our 12GB test file to the card in 52 seconds on average. It took a mere 20 seconds to read the file back to our PC. The write test with our smaller 1.15GB test folder, meanwhile, averaged just 4.5 seconds.
 
It all adds up to performance that's at least twice as fast as the best UHS-I models we’ve tested in terms of sequential reads and writes, with three or four times the speeds in some cases. The gulf in random reads and writes is similar, and in some benchmarks even greater. But you need a pricey SD card reader to even see those increases on a PC, so only those with a Switch 2 in hand or serious cash to burn should consider one of these things.
 
Other notable microSD cards
 

 
 
 
Samsung Pro Ultimate
 
The Samsung Pro Ultimate was the closest competitor to the Lexar Professional Silver Plus across our benchmark tests, but it's tangibly worse in terms of sequential write speeds, typically costs more and doesn’t offer a 1TB option. The Samsung Pro Plus is a bit slower for sequential reads, but it’s close enough otherwise and usually easier to find at a lower price.
 
Lexar Professional Gold
 
We haven't used it ourselves, but if you’re willing to pay for a more powerful UHS-II card built for heavy-duty video recording, the Lexar Professional Gold has tested well elsewhere and should deliver significantly faster sequential write speeds than our UHS-I picks above. It’s one of the few UHS-II cards we could actually find in stock, but it’s pricey, with a 128GB model normally priced in the $35 to $40 range.
 

 
 
 
SanDisk Extreme
 
The SanDisk Extreme effectively matched the Pro Plus in a few of our sequential tests, but that was partly due to us only being able to secure the 256GB model, which is higher-rated than the 128GB version. It’s a fine choice if you see it on sale at a reputable seller, but it’s broadly slower than our top pick and often costs more.
 
SanDisk GamePlay
 
The SanDisk GamePlay performs similarly to the SanDisk Extreme but costs a good bit extra as of our latest update. We couldn’t get it to reach its advertised speeds with the company’s own “Pro” card reader or other third-party options, so it fell short of our top picks.
 
SanDisk Pokémon
 
The SanDisk Pokémon does outperform its advertised read and write speeds, but not by enough to outpace the Lexar Silver Plus or Samsung Pro Plus. It essentially charges extra for having a picture of Pikachu (or Gengar, or Snorlax) on a product you’ll never look at.
 

 
 
 
SanDisk Extreme Pro
 
The SanDisk Extreme Pro is a close analog to the Samsung Pro Ultimate but, as of this writing, is either unavailable at most trusted retailers or priced too high by comparison. The Lexar Professional Silver Plus has faster sequential write speeds as well.
 
PNY XLR8 Gaming
 
The PNY XLR8 is an affordable card that comes with up to 512GB of space. Its sequential and random writes speeds checked in a little bit above those of Samsung’s Evo Select, plus it comes with a lifetime warranty. But its sequential reads were much, much slower, putting it out of contention.
 
PNY Elite-X
 
The PNY Elite-X often goes for cheap and wasn’t too far off the random read/write performance of Samsung's Pro Plus in CrystalDiskMark. Like the XLR8, it’s also slightly above the Evo Select in write speeds. But its sequential reads were too far behind all of our top picks, and it no longer appears to be available in capacities above 256GB.
 
What to look for in a microSD card
 
Capacity
 
The first thing to figure out when buying a microSD card is how much storage space you need. Modern cards are commonly available in sizes ranging from 32GB to 512GB, with several models now available in 1TB or 1.5TB capacities as well. The first 2TB cards from major brands have started to arrive as well, which is exciting, but those are still fairly rare (and very expensive) by comparison.
 
For many, a 128GB or 256GB model should be a sweet spot between price and storage space. But if you need more room — say, for stashing a bunch of games on a Steam Deck — a 512GB card or greater could make more sense and often provides a better cost-per-GB ratio. 
 
Pricing and stock levels are all over the place as of our most recent update thanks to ongoing AI-driven shortages, but you can typically still find a decent 128GB card for around $15, a good 256GB card for less than $30 and a solid 512GB card for around $40 (with faster models priced a little higher). There’s a starker increase when you go up to 1TB cards, which often cost closer to $100, though we’ve seen some fall into the $70 to $80 range over the last year. The first 2TB cards are a bigger leap: the 2TB SanDisk Extreme, for example, currently has a list price around $290, which is way up from what we saw in 2025.
 
Note that a microSD card’s performance may differ depending on what capacity you buy. SanDisk says its 128GB Extreme card delivers sequential write speeds up to 90 MB/s, for example, while the higher-capacity models in the same line offer up to 130 MB/s.
 
When we talk about microSD cards today, we mostly refer to cards that use the microSDXC (eXtended Capacity) standard, which have a capacity between 32GB and 2TB. Your device needs to support this for it to work with a microSDXC card. This will almost never be an issue these days, but some older devices (a Nintendo 3DS, for instance) are only compatible with microSDHC (High Capacity) cards, which range from 2GB to 32GB.
 

 
 
 
Read and write speeds
 
MicroSD cards are primarily judged on their read and write speeds, which are usually measured in megabytes per second (MB/s). Generally, most microSD cards have faster read speeds than write speeds.
 
These metrics can then be broken down into sequential and random performance. Sequential read and write speeds matter when you’re trying to access (read) or save (write) long, constant streams of data, such as opening a large video or copying a big batch of files from a PC. If you want to use a microSD card for media storage, this is particularly important. Random performance, meanwhile, is about how quickly a card can read and write small files scattered throughout the device.
 
Since random read/write speeds are much lower than sequential ones, storage device makers tend not to advertise them as loudly. But they’re important if you use a card with a gaming device or a single-board computer like the Raspberry Pi, where it often has to rapidly save and access small bits of data in random locations.
 

 
 
 
Speed ratings
 
If you look at a microSD card, you’ll see a buffet of numbers, letters and symbols. Most of these refer to the card’s speed class and performance ratings, which are determined by the SD Association.
 
A card’s Video Speed Class, or V-rating, details its minimum sequential write speed, which is especially important when recording video from a camera. It ranges from V6 to V90. Most of the cards we tested had a V30 rating, so they have a sequential write speed of at least 30 MB/s. This should be enough to support up to 4K video at lower bitrates. Higher-rated V60 and V90 cards are usually better for capturing 8K, but they come at a much higher cost.
 
The UHS Speed Class, or U-rating, also refers to a card’s minimum sequential write speed. It comes in two varieties: U3, which mandates a minimum of 30 MB/s, and U1, which is rated for 10 MB/s.
 
The older Speed Class rating overlaps with the other two systems. It’s signified by a C symbol and goes from Class 2 to Class 10, with the number (again) indicating minimum sequential write speed. This rating is less relevant nowadays, but you may still see a “C10” logo on some cards.
 
The Application Performance spec, marked by an A symbol, is an indicator of random read/write speeds. This is measured in IOPS, or input/output operations per second, rather than MB/s. There are two categories here: A1 cards offer a minimum random read speed of 1,500 IOPS and a minimum random write speed of 500 IOPS, while A2 cards bump those up to 4,000 IOPS and 2,000 IOPS, respectively. Both ratings also guarantee sequential write speeds of at least 10 MB/s.
 
To keep it simple, most people should look for a card with V30, U3 and A2 ratings. It’s totally possible to get a solid card without those: A U1 card might be worth it if you just need a cheap, high-capacity option, for example. V60 and V90 cards are worth a look if you’re serious about shooting high-resolution photos and video as well. But overall, cards with the certifications above should provide the best blend of price and performance today.
 
It’s important to emphasize that these ratings are baselines. Most V30 cards offer significantly higher write speeds than 30 MB/s, for instance, and some A1 cards can outperform some A2 models in practice. The speeds advertised by manufacturers aren’t always 100 percent accurate, either: Sometimes the card will be slower in real-world use, other times it may actually be a bit faster.
 

 
 
 
 
UHS bus speeds
 
The other spec to note is the card’s bus interface. Most microSD cards available today are UHS-I, which has a theoretical maximum speed of 104 MB/s. There are also UHS-II cards, which have an extra row of pins on the back and can reach up to 312 MB/s. (A UHS-III standard technically exists as well but hasn’t seen wide adoption.) These are labeled on the card with a Roman numeral I or II.
 
UHS-II cards are typically the ones with those higher V60 or V90 ratings. If you shoot lots of 4K to 8K video or frequently use burst mode to capture ultra high-res photos, the performance gains of a good UHS-II card can save you time.
 
However, these are typically much more expensive than UHS-I cards: This 128GB Lexar Professional Gold model, for instance, is a relative bargain at $35. While that's less than many UHS-II models we’ve seen in the past, it's still more than double the common street price of our top pick above. You need a device that’s compatible with the UHS-II interface to see any benefits, too, and stock for UHS-II cards is often spottier. For now, the higher speeds aren’t worth the price premium for most people, so we stuck mostly to UHS-I cards with our recommendations.
 

 
 
  Unlike traditional UHS-I cards, a microSD Express card like the SanDisk model on the right comes with a second row of pins to enable its improved performance.
 
 
 
microSD Express and the Nintendo Switch 2
 
The absolute fastest microSD cards you can buy, however, are based on a different interface called SD Express. This has technically been around for several years and now includes its own subset of speed classes, but the gist is that it's much faster than UHS-I or UHS-II: SanDisk’s recently released microSD Express card, one of the first commercially available models, advertises sequential read speeds up to 880MB/s. That’s quicker than some older SSDs.
 
It’s a substantial upgrade that has largely held up in our testing, but very few popular devices natively support SD Express today. The first major exception is the Nintendo Switch 2, which is only compatible with the newer standard, as it’s needed to keep up with the performance demands of new handheld games.
 
Besides SanDisk, manufacturers like Samsung, Lexar and PNY have already launched microSD Express cards to go with the console. The presumption is that having such a popular device embrace the tech will only further its adoption and drive prices down.
 
But it’s still early days, and right now all microSD Express cards cost much more than the best UHS-I or even UHS-II options. Beyond the Switch 2, it’s possible to take advantage of these cards’ superior speeds with a dedicated SD Express card reader, but that adds even more to the final cost. It’s also worth noting that SD Express cards are not backwards compatible with UHS-II (or UHS-III), so if you try to plug one into a device with a UHS-II slot, it’ll be limited to UHS-I speeds. Still, they’re a must for Nintendo fans going forward, and the tech should have plenty of appeal if more gadgets that support the interface do arrive. 
 
For more on how the first wave of Express cards perform on the Switch 2, we've put together a dedicated buying guide just for Nintendo's console. 
 

 
 
 
A note on card readers and reaching advertised speeds
 
While the UHS-I interface has a theoretical maximum of 104 MB/s, some UHS-I cards can exceed that speed through proprietary extensions. However, you need a compatible card reader and host device to take advantage of that extra performance. If you find a UHS-I card advertising speeds higher than 104 MB/s, this is what’s going on. You can see these limits in action with an original Nintendo Switch or Steam Deck: Both of those gaming devices support the UHS-I interface but don’t go beyond its official speed, flattening any sequential gains some cards may have elsewhere. (Differences in random read and write speeds can still matter, though.) The same thing will happen if you plug a more powerful UHS-II or SD Express card into a device that doesn’t accept those interfaces.
 
The takeaway: Your microSD card will only be as fast as the slowest link in your chain.
 
Warranty
 
Many microSD cards are designed to be durable, with protection from water, extreme temperatures, X-rays and drops. Still, in case of catastrophe, a long warranty is always good to have. Many manufacturers offer lifetime or 10-year limited warranties, though we’ve noticed that “endurance” cards marketed to withstand more hours of writing are usually covered for a shorter period of time. For example, Samsung's Pro Endurance, a model aimed at security cameras and other monitoring devices, comes with a five-year warranty.
 
Avoiding counterfeits
 
The memory card market has had a particular problem with scammers selling fake products. To guard against this, only buy from a known brand and a reputable retailer such as Best Buy, B&H Photo or Adorama. If you shop at Amazon, only buy if the shipper and seller is Amazon.com. (That said, a handful of users have reported receiving counterfeits even from Amazon directly in the past, so exercise caution.) Remember: If a price seems too good to be true, it probably is. Be wary of any retailer offering a significantly lower price than everyone else.
 
Once you receive a card, check its packaging for any irregularities. You can run benchmark tests like CrystalDiskMark or BlackMagic Disk Speed Test to verify its speeds aren’t drastically lower than what’s advertised (or possible, given its specs). You can also use software that’s designed to verify the true capacity and performance of your card, such as H2testw and FakeFlashTest.

How we test microSD cards
 
We've put about 20 microSD cards through a series of tests to verify their sequential and random performance. These included benchmarks like CrystalDiskMark, BlackMagic Disk Speed Test, ATTO Disk Benchmark and AJA System Test, as well as a few “real-world” tests. We copied and pasted a small folder of photos about 1.15GB in size to and from each card, then did the same with a larger 12.2GB folder containing multiple file types and subfolders, timing the process each time. We also checked how each card performed on the Steam Deck, downloading games of varying sizes — including Stardew Valley, Aperture Desk Job, Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance and Apex Legends — then timing how long it took to launch each game and load save files. We do multiple runs of each test to verify our findings and account for potential outliers. 
 
Where applicable, we used a Kingston USB 3.2 UHS-II reader to test each card on both Windows 11 and macOS Sequoia. However, if a card could be bundled with (or is specifically advertised to use) a proprietary reader, we mainly tested with that, since we figure that’s the one most interested buyers will end up using. For Windows testing, we used an Alienware gaming PC with an Intel Core i9-10900F, Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 GPU, 32GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD. For macOS, we used a 2021 16-inch MacBook Pro with an Apple M1 Pro chip, 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD. If a reader couldn’t connect over USB-C, we used CalDigit’s TS4 dock to test the corresponding card on the MacBook.
 
We tested the 128GB version of each card whenever we could, though we were only able to test higher-capacity models for a few options. We also reformatted each card before testing with the SD Association’s Memory Card Formatter tool.
 
For microSD Express cards, we ran each model through a series of tests specific to the Switch 2, since that is the only popular device that actually supports the tech. You can read more about that process in our separate buying guide linked above.

We plan to test more new microSD Express cards for a future update.
 
February 2025: We’ve updated this guide with a new top pick: the Lexar Professional Silver Plus. The Samsung Pro Plus, our previous recommendation, stays as a runner-up. We’ve also added SanDisk’s recently released microSD Express card as a pick for those who want the absolute fastest card possible, albeit with heavy caveats. This is one of the first microSD cards to use the SD Express bus interface, so we’ve included more details on what that entails in our “what to look for in a microSD card” section. Lastly, we’ve removed our write-up for SanDisk’s Apex Legends card, as it appears to have been discontinued, and included testing notes for a couple of the company’s more recent releases.
 
November 2024: We've checked back with this guide to ensure our recommendations are still accurate and made light edits for clarity. 
 
August 2024: We’ve updated this guide to note the recently released 1TB models for three of our top picks: the Samsung Pro Plus, the Kingston Canvas Go Plus and the Samsung Evo Select. We’ve also made sure all pricing details are as up to date as they can be.

Tomtoc’s hard zip-up case for the Nintendo Switch 2 is the best one out there, with a slim, minimalist look available in multiple colors, a sleeve for storing 12 game cartridges, and occasionally a competitive price. You can get the lowest price that we’ve seen on select colors, including black, gray, white, and its matcha green gradient option for around $24 (originally $36.99) at Amazon when you enter the code YX2SATAXQVMO at checkout. It’s the only case that I’ve tested that includes some padding near the top of the Switch 2 system to keep it from moving around in the event of a drop. Here’s my buying guide covering this and other great Switch 2 cases.
Ethernet switches don’t have to cost you a lot of money. My needs are met by this eight-port TP-Link gigabit switch that’s under $20. However, it’s possible that you’re you’re paying a lot for fast internet service and you really want to make sure you’re getting your money’s worth. If that’s the case, Netgear’s five-port switch, which supports up to 2.5-gigabit connections, is back to its lowest price at Amazon, costing $69.99. Outside this discount, which has only happened once before during January, it costs $99.99.
Woot has a nice deal on a new AMD Ryzen 9 7900X desktop processor. The 2022 CPU typically costs $350 at most retailers, but you can purchase it for $239.99 while supplies last. It’s a great deal if you’re assembling a capable gaming PC while trying to save as much money as possible. This processor must be paired with a motherboard that has an AM5 socket. Unlike Intel’s strategy of shifting sockets every couple of generations, AM5 is still being used by AMD processors. In other words, you can upgrade later to an 8000 or 9000-series CPU without having to completely uproot your build.</p></article>

But you’re still going to be wary of it dying on you if you’re on a trip or just having a particularly screen-heavy day. That’s where Apple’s iPhone Air MagSafe battery pack comes in, and it’s currently on sale for $79.
 

 
 
This accessory only works with the iPhone Air, but much like the phone it attaches to, it’s extremely slim at 7.5mmm, so crucially doesn’t add so much bulk when attached that it defeats the point of having a thin phone in the first place. The MagSafe Battery isn’t enormous at 3,149mAh (enough to add an extra 65 percent of charge to the Air), but it can wirelessly charge the AirPods Pro 3 as well, making it an even more useful travel companion. You can also charge your iPhone while charging the battery pack.
 
At its regular price of $99, the MagSafe battery pack is an admittedly pricey add-on to what is already an expensive phone, but for $20 off it’s well worth considering what Engadget’s Sam Rutherford called an "essential accessory" for some users in his iPhone Air review.
 
Many Apple loyalists will always insist on having first-party accessories for their iPhone, but there are plenty of third-party MagSafe chargers out there too, a lot of them considerably cheaper than Apple’s lineup. Be sure to check out our guide for those.

The multi-touch mouse was first released in 2009 with a modest refresh released in 2015 and the addition of a USB-C port in 2024. The rechargeable mouse features gesture controls and automatically pairs with your Mac when connected via USB. The Magic Mouse can also be used with an iPad via Bluetooth, or with a Windows PC, though in that case, functionality would be limited.
 
Famously, Jony Ive's design of the Magic Mouse sees its charge port on the underside of the body, rendering it unusable while charging. In 2024 there were rumors of a more comprehensive redesign coming but nothing has materialized since.

After years of speculation, multiple reports now suggest Apple could be aiming for a launch in the second half of 2026, with new details trickling out about the phone’s design, display tech and where it might sit in the iPhone lineup.
As with any unannounced Apple product, nothing is locked in. Features can change, timelines can move and some ideas may never make it beyond internal testing. That said, recent reporting from supply-chain sources, analysts and leakers gives us a clearer picture of how Apple might approach its first foldable and how it could try to set itself apart from rivals like Samsung and Google.
Below, we’ve rounded up the most credible iPhone Fold rumors so far, covering everything from possible release timing and form factor to display details, cameras and pricing. We’ll keep updating this post as new information emerges.
When could the iPhone Fold launch?
Rumors of a foldable iPhone date back as far as 2017, but more recent reporting suggests Apple has finally locked onto a realistic window. Most sources now point to fall 2026, likely alongside the iPhone 18 lineup.
Mark Gurman has gone back and forth on timing, initially suggesting Apple could launch “as early as 2026,” before later writing that the device would ship at the end of 2026 and sell primarily in 2027. Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has also repeatedly cited the second half of 2026 as Apple’s target.
Some reports still claim the project could slip into 2027 if Apple runs into manufacturing or durability issues, particularly around the hinge or display. Given Apple’s history of delaying products that it feels aren’t ready, that remains a real possibility.
What will the iPhone Fold look like?
Current consensus suggests Apple has settled on a book-style foldable design, similar to Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold series, rather than a clamshell flip phone.
When unfolded, the iPhone Fold is expected to resemble a small tablet like the iPad mini (8.3 inches). Based on the rumor mill, though, the iPhone Fold may be a touch smaller, with an internal display measuring around 7.7 to 7.8 inches. When closed, it should function like a conventional smartphone, with an outer display in the 5.5-inch range.
CAD leaks and alleged case-maker molds suggest the device may be shorter and wider than a standard iPhone when folded, creating a squarer footprint that better matches the aspect ratio of the inner display. Several reports have also pointed to the iPhone Air as a potential preview of Apple’s foldable design work, with its unusually thin chassis widely interpreted as a look at what one half of a future foldable iPhone could resemble.
If that theory holds, it could help explain the Fold’s rumored dimensions. Thickness is expected to land between roughly 4.5 and 5.6mm when unfolded, putting it in a similar range to the iPhone Air, and just over 9 to 11mm when folded, depending on the final hinge design and internal layering.

Display and the crease question
The display is arguably the biggest challenge for any foldable phone, and it’s an area where Apple appears to have invested years of development.
Multiple reports say Apple will rely on Samsung Display as its primary supplier. At CES 2026, Samsung showcased a new crease-less foldable OLED panel, which several sources — including Bloomberg — suggested could be the same technology Apple plans to use.
According to these reports, the panel combines a flexible OLED with a laser-drilled metal support plate that disperses stress when folding. The goal is a display with a nearly invisible crease, something Apple reportedly considers essential before entering the foldable market.
If Apple does use this panel, it would mark a notable improvement over current foldables, which still show visible creasing under certain lighting conditions.
Cameras and biometrics
Camera rumors suggest Apple is planning a four-camera setup. That may include:

Two rear cameras (main and ultra-wide, both rumored at 48MP)

One punch-hole camera on the outer display

One under-display camera on the inner screen

Several sources claim Apple will avoid Face ID entirely on the iPhone Fold. Instead, it’s expected to rely on Touch ID built into the power button, similar to recent iPad models. This would allow Apple to keep both displays free of notches or Dynamic Island cutouts.
Under-display camera technology has historically produced lower image quality, but a rumored 24MP sensor would be a significant step up compared to existing foldables, which typically use much lower-resolution sensors.
iPhone Fold’s hinge and materials
The hinge is another area where Apple may diverge from competitors. Multiple reports claim Apple will use Liquidmetal, which is a long-standing trade name for a metallic glass alloy the company has previously used in smaller components. While often referred to as “liquid metal” or “Liquid Metal” in reports, Liquidmetal is the branding Apple has historically associated with the material.
Liquidmetal is said to be stronger and more resistant to deformation than titanium, while remaining relatively lightweight. If accurate, this could help improve long-term durability and reduce wear on the foldable display.
Leaks from Jon Prosser also reference a metal plate beneath the display that works in tandem with the hinge to minimize creasing — a claim that aligns with reporting from Korean and Chinese supply-chain sources.
Battery and other components 
Battery life is another potential differentiator. According to Ming-Chi Kuo and multiple Asian supply-chain reports, Apple is testing high-density battery cells in the 5,000 to 5,800mAh range.
That would make it the largest battery ever used in an iPhone, and competitive with (or larger than) batteries in current Android foldables. The device is also expected to use a future A-series chip and Apple’s in-house modem.
Price
None of this will come cheap, that’s for certain. Nearly every report agrees that the iPhone Fold will be Apple’s most expensive iPhone ever.
Estimates currently place the price between $2,000 and $2,500 in the US. Bloomberg has said the price will be “at least $2,000,” while other analysts have narrowed the likely range to around $2,100 and $2,300. That positions the iPhone Fold well above the iPhone Pro Max and closer to Apple’s high-end Macs and iPads.
Despite years of rumors, there’s still plenty that remains unclear. Apple hasn’t confirmed the name “iPhone Fold,” final dimensions, software features or how iOS would adapt to a folding form factor. Durability, repairability and long-term reliability are also open questions. For now, the safest assumption is that Apple is taking its time and that many of these details could still change before launch.

<article><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/podcast/875233/siemens-ceo-roland-busch-ai-automation-digital-twins-nato-tariffs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Siemens CEO Roland Busch’s mission to automate everything</a></h2><p class="meta">The Verge — 10/02/2026, 00:00:00</p><p class="summary">Today, I’m talking with Roland Busch, who is the CEO of Siemens.
Siemens is one of those absolutely giant, extremely important, but fairly opaque companies we love to dig into on Decoder. At a very basic, reductive level, Siemens makes the hardware and software that allow other companies to run and automate their stuff. Everyone has seen the Siemens logo somewhere, whether it’s under the hood of their cars, stamped on control systems in fancy buildings, or scattered across factory floors. But since it’s not really a consumer-facing company, it’s hard to know what ties all these ideas together — and what some 320,000 Siemens employees across the world are actually working on. 
How all those people are organized and work together is wildly complicated. Roland and I spent some real time just talking through the Siemens corporate structure, which, for my true Decoderheads out there, was incredibly fascinating. 



Verge subscribers, don’t forget you get exclusive access to ad-free Decoder wherever you get your podcasts. Head here. Not a subscriber? You can sign up here. 
We also spent a lot of time talking about automation broadly and what happens as AI brings automation from the physical world of factories into the digital world of accounting and procurement — the things that help decide what factories should be doing. Roland’s vision is for Siemens to automate the whole factory process, upstream and downstream of actually making things. And you’ll hear him describe that outcome as fairly utopian: a smooth, seamless, optimal operation. Very German. But I wanted to press him on how dystopian it sounds to me. Because in Roland’s vision, it seems like there’s a whole class of people who just… don’t have jobs anymore. And the ones who do have jobs don’t really have a whole lot of autonomy or fulfillment from them, but basically just serve as the hands for the all-seeing AI. So I asked him fairly directly about that.
And if that’s not already all complicated enough: Siemens is a government and defense contractor on both sides of the Atlantic and a company whose overall growth is directly tied to free trade and globalization in the postwar era. A lot is going on right now that might challenge how the world works, especially if tensions keep rising between the US and Europe, and so I had to ask him point-blank: Do you think about what you’ll do if NATO collapses? Because that’s not as far-fetched a question as it used to be.
There’s a lot in this one, and Roland was game for it all. I think you’ll leave with a lot to think about — certainly more to think about whenever you see all those Siemens logos.
Okay: Siemens CEO Roland Busch. Here we go.


This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.
Roland Busch, you are the president and CEO of Siemens. Welcome to Decoder.
Thank you, Nilay. Nice to meet you.
It’s nice to meet you as well. There’s a lot to talk about. Siemens is a huge company. It has a long history. You’ve been in a lot of businesses, you’ve been out of a lot of businesses. You have worked there since the ’90s. The world is very complicated right now, and Siemens is a very big, very complicated multinational operating in that world. I’m curious how you are thinking of all that.
So let me just start at the start: Siemens isn’t a consumer company. I think a lot of Decoder listeners have seen the logo, but maybe don’t understand the company. How would you describe Siemens today? What is the company?
Indeed, it’s not that easy. We have come a long way. It’s been more than 170 years since the company was founded, and we made so many changes in our portfolio and in our company. Actually, when people talk about it, I say there’s one constant in our history, which is that we reinvented ourselves over and over again. And absolutely, we are now in the midst of another reinvention or transformation with one difference. This is the fastest and most fundamental one we ever had because of technology. And then people ask, “What is Siemens about? Because you now have Siemens Healthineers, you have Siemens Energy, you have Siemens?”
And actually, it’s not that easy to describe. Siemens Healthineers has the task in its name. It’s about healthcare. Siemens Energy has the task in its name; it’s about energy. But Siemens is not that clear. So here is how I explain it. We transform, with our technology, every day for everyone. Okay, that doesn’t get you closer. But now, the point is that you have to look behind the curtain, and then you see what Siemens technology does.
When you see a car passing by… Eventually, all cars will be touched by Siemens technology. It is either cars that are designed by our technology, or they are manufactured by it. Every third manufacturing line in the world is run by Siemens controls. If you walk through New York, you cannot walk a block without passing by a building that is automated by Siemens technology. I think we are controlling … I mean, something like a little bit less than 50 percent of electrons are touched by Siemens technologies in our distribution systems, low voltage systems. And if you talk about healthcare, if you get a scan somewhere in the world, the likelihood that it’s a Siemens CT or MR scan is a little bit shy of 50 percent. And this is what we do. We produce. We have technology which enables others to transform their everyday. And that is what Siemens is about.
So I listen to that, and I experience Siemens everywhere. I’m the person who pays attention to how a building is automated. I talk to a lot of car CEOs; I hear about Siemens as a supplier to the car industry quite a bit. It sounds like what you were describing basically is you operate things for people, or you build technologies or products that operate other things for people.
There are a lot of things in the world to operate. How do you organize the company? How do you think about where there’s opportunity and where there’s growth and investment, and then how do you think about your resources? Because it seems like we operate things for everyone. That’s a pretty wide remit that you could focus down in any number of ways.
This is an absolutely valid question because now we are active in so many different industries. It’s industries, manufacturing, process industries, but we are also in buildings, grids, and mobility. So people, trains, and signaling systems. The first basis of Siemens is — and this is where our value sits — in our technology platform, and in our design software. We have one of the largest software companies in the world. If it comes to industrial software, we are the largest. And with our software, you can build the most comprehensive physics-based digital twin of whatever product you do. And we are now expanding into molecules. So another one is automation technology, as talked about, or it can be for discrete process manufacturing. We also go for software-defined automation, which is kind of a disruption. Anything. We are the largest automation company. We are automating grids, we’re automating buildings, we’re automating signaling systems, we’re automating trains, and we are automating manufacturing. So the underlying technology is where the value is.
Now, we are bringing this technology to different verticals, so markets. It’s the industrial markets, food and beverage, chemicals, automotive, machine builders, utilities, mobility operators, and the like. And then at this point, the domain know-how comes into play. So having technology is one thing, but having the domain know-how to deploy it, to talk customers’ language, is another one. And on top, quite obviously, is that the whole thing is now supercharged by AI technologies, which we are rolling in as we speak. We have a long history regarding AI. Actually, one of the first supercomputers to do machine learning algorithms was Synopsys. I mean, this was in the ’90s. Siemens had the most powerful one. This was the great-grandfather of the GPUs today.
And since then, we have been working with artificial intelligence technologies, but this is now a new level that we want to bring it to. So the organization, obviously, we are organizing according to businesses. They are reflecting the markets we are acting in, but you have to look at it from the back, the underlying technology, including the data, which is super relevant.
I’m very curious to talk to you about AI and automation. I think that’s very important. Digital twins, I’m curious about that. It seems like the future of automation is very rich. We’re moving from Siemens automating a lot of atoms, automating the physical world, to automating bits, and that’s a long conversation that I want to come to.
I just want to stay focused on the company for one more turn here and ask the Decoder questions, because I feel like the structure of Siemens says a lot about the company itself. I was reading your last letter to shareholders. You were talking about how you’ve divested portfolio companies where you weren’t the best owner, you’re exiting some businesses, and you’re obviously investing in others. How is Siemens organized today? How is the company structured?
We run according to businesses. One is digital industries, which is all about the software, the automation piece. One is smart infrastructure. Here you’ll find our building technology, medium voltage, low voltage, but also the grid, grid automation, grid control, and grid soft control software. The third element is Siemens mobility, where we have our trains, high-speed locomotives, commuter, metro, light rail, but also rail infrastructure, including turnkey projects, which is part of that. And the last one, since we are still consolidating, is Siemens Healthineers, where we still hold some 70 percent. It is its own listed company, a DAX-listed company. We are about to let go. We announced a spinoff of 30 percent from 65-ish, but it’s a separate company. So that’s how we’re organized. Of course, we have our corporate organizations, like strategy. IT, we run horizontally. We have our M&A department, and I talked about our portfolio. So that’s what a corporation normally has.
And maybe one more special thing is that we still have research. We still invest 8 percent of our revenue, so $6.5 billion, a portion of which goes into research advancements. We work on a quantum computer. We don’t build them, but we run on the software, the middleware, how to use it, and the applications. And we have also machine learning and KEI experts who are doing research there, like AI experts. So that’s roughly how the company runs. And then talking about regions, we have in total, including Healthineers, 320,000 people. We have 45,000 people sitting in the United States, 30,000 in China, 35,000 in India, and roughly 85,000 in Germany. It’s still a German company. There’s a lot of manufacturing here.
That’s a lot of people. 
Indeed.
Let me ask you about that split between regions. I think a theme on Decoder recently, and you are a part of this trend, is that a lot of these companies are a lot bigger than people think. You described divisions, you described regions. Those are both potentially first-order organizations for companies, right? I talk to lots of CEOs, and regions are just the first-order organization. Other companies are divisions. You have both. How do those interact?
Yeah, I can tell you, this is a constant discussion because we have very strong regional leads. We have strong businesses. So this is a matrix, and every company has this matrix, and the first question is, which one is the predominant line? Is it the business or the regions? In our case, it’s a clear answer; it’s the businesses. So the businesses have the full P&L. Regions are, let’s say, the second derivative behind it. Still very strong. And we have, in some businesses, let’s take, for example, our low voltage business, switching technology, this business is fully run by regions. You have China, you have the United States, you have Europe, and this is their P&L. So roll it up by regions. If you talk about automation, the next level is still … It’s motion control for machine builders, it’s factory automation, it’s process automation, and then come the regions. Therefore, you still have a different kind of setup depending on the business on how we serve technologies.
And then the third dimension, just to make it a little bit more complicated for you, is the verticals, because factory automation… Take factory automation, which is maybe the strongest automation business we have; they run into any kind of factory automation you can imagine. The discreet and hybrids, food and beverage, and automotive machines. Machine builders are by machine, control is another one, but then you have a lot of battery manufacturing, and you have semiconductors. Therefore, this is the third dimension to serve verticals, because each of them has a different language and different applications. So we are having a very, let’s say, three-dimensional matrix, but there’s a clear lead, and this is driven by the business lines.
Yeah. I ask everybody on Decoder how the businesses are structured. And the joke I always make is, if you tell me how the company is structured, I can tell you 80 percent of your problems. But in the case of Siemens, it seems like I’m still trying to figure it all out to even get to where the problems are. When you think about that organization, and you describe things like a common platform or shared innovation across these zones or the investments you need to make in AI, a lot of your competitors are new. They’re essentially functionally organized.
Yes.
There’s one person driving the business in the case of some of these startups. Siemens is very old. It’s organized divisionally, and then obviously, there are layers of organization between it. How do you think about investing in the core technologies, the core platforms in that structure? Because it seems like all of your divisions should be doing it, perhaps in redundant or repetitive ways.
Yeah, and you’re right. When I explain my organization, you can identify the problems or the opportunities, put it that way. And here comes the point. I talked about how we are investing $6.5 billion into R&D, and obviously, this goes into different businesses. And some of them have a higher share. This is 8 percent on average. Some of them are sitting on definitely more than 10 percent, 13 percent, 15 percent, some others are at 3 percent and 4 percent. So, capital allocation, is it R&D? Is it in CapEx, or also spending? That’s done business by business. Each of them has a business case, and we allocate capital. In some cases, we obviously want to allocate more capital in higher growth areas. And I talk about organic capital allocation if it comes to M&A. This is something that happens on the board. We come up with proposals, and we see where we want to spend more money and where we focus our M&A, and where we do not.
But then here comes the point, and this is the part of our ONE Tech company program. Actually, I started last year, together with my fellow board members, maybe one of the most fundamental transformations of our organizations, because you’re completely right, we are very much boxed. Below these businesses I talked about, like digital industries, we have software, and then we have automation. Automation is three boxes: factory automation, process automation, and motion control. Below that, we have even segments, so I just didn’t give you that complexity as well. We are very much boxed. And what we want to do is take layers out, so we bring that into bigger boxes. Actually, we are targeting six units. But then we also say we want to create fabrics, which is a kind of operating system where we have horizontal ones. So we have a data fabric, a technology fabric, and we have a sales fabric.
So the idea behind this fabric is it’s a thin layer, but it’s a very strong one where we are really scaling horizontally as much as we can. For sales fabric, for example, we want to use the same tools, the same nomenclature for customers. And believe it or not, if I ask today how much revenue we do with BMW, people have to run out and pile the numbers together. This stops now because we have one identifier for BMW, and with a push of a button, I know what to do. So they serve the same sales methodology. Also, the customer journeys should all be alike. Technology fabric is that we don’t do things over and over again. When we talk about a digital platform where we sell, we build it only once and sell our portfolio.
So this is a change. We are unboxing our organization in two little boxes. And the reason is… Number one is technology, and AI in particular doesn’t respect silos. AI doesn’t respect data silos, doesn’t respect any kind of boundaries. The world is squeezing out the small. You see that this is adding more and more, and the more data you have, the more capabilities you have, the stronger you are. It’s a fact. Look at the big companies. Therefore, we have to play to the strengths of Siemens, and this requires a different way of running this company. This is behind our ONE Tech company program, which is really pulling in horizontally as much as we can, yet respecting different go-to-markets and different kinds of technologies or applications of technologies, depending on the verticals we are serving. So, not losing our strengths, which we have built over so many years, while scaling horizontally. Does it make sense?
It does. I’ve never been so excited to talk about structure with anyone as I have been with you, because that seems very hard. Well, it seems like what you’re describing to me is a multi-hundred-year-old company that has traditionally been very divisional, trying to get to some functional structures so that you can move faster. And that traditionally has come with culture cost, it has come with disruption inside the company, it’s come with inertia. How are you dealing with that at a company the size of Siemens? There are 320,000 people. They can’t all be happy with you.
It’s hard. It’s hard. So where do you start? Give a little bit of insight into how we did in the past and how we do it right now with our ONE Tech company program. In the past, we had many restructurings and many changes. The point was a managing board, these are typically something, but we have now seven people, and we used to have 15 or more, whatever. In the past, these guys were going together with their strategies in a room, defining a new structure, laying out a new org chart, and then, “Dear colleagues, this is where we want to go, and we reshuffle.” Okay. You can imagine how that goes down. This time, we created a north star where we want to be. The north star is basically what I sketched to you, these fabrics, the businesses, but allow them to focus on what they need to do, focus on their customers, on their applications, but yet we want to get horizontals into it.
And then we said, “This is a north star and here are, we call it tracks, the tracks to the north star. These are the points where we really want to touch.” For example, our CRM system for automation was completely scattered. We want to do that, and this is a blueprint for the whole company, which can go on and on. And then we engaged people to say, “Let’s go,, and you work with us now on these tracks and how to change it.” That means we give the people an opportunity to contribute, to bring their ideas, but we have a clear idea of where we want to go in order to move first. Secondly, you obviously need to communicate a lot. You have to explain what you do because you’re describing something where people don’t know where it goes; they’re not experienced to work that way. But you have to talk about it over and over again, explain why we do it, what the benefits are, and what changes for the people.
And for some, they said, “I don’t experience any change.” “Yes, because we don’t touch everything. We touch only things where you really can improve.” And some we just let go, because why would you fix something that’s not broken? The next one is that we train our people, because transformation is not just shifting boxes; it’s a different set of values. Collaboration is a much, much more important element in it. So we are putting a lot of emphasis on helping them also. And change is not only a structure, but it’s also the processes behind the way you lead. And the last thing is, obviously, you also want to inject capabilities from the outside, on a higher level, where you have people who know what good looks like when it comes to a super professional sales organization, when it comes to AI technologies and more developing models, and this helps a lot.
And then we do that all over the company, on the lower level, and the higher level. But if you talk to a really high-level person, if you come with people who really have the gravitas, who bring the experience where nobody would doubt that if they say, “This is how modern software looks like,” they have authority themselves without giving them the stars and stripes. They just put people together and say, “This is how we go.” And people listen and follow. So this is the package, and you need all of them, all of them, in order to make this transformation.
And I can say it seems to work. I had a huge respect for it. I’m a lifetimer at Siemens, and I saw in my 30 years so many changes and programs. And before pulling the trigger for this big change, which is the deepest one for the last at least 20 years, you think about it twice, because if this vessel runs in the wrong direction, you have a problem. And we have to deliver at the same time. But I pulled the trigger because I knew that we had to change. The environment of technology is changing so fast, so we have to be at the forefront, but I’m quite happy because it has been running for one year and is making good progress. There’s another one ahead of us. By the end of the fiscal year…  So by the end of this, by October, November, we are basically through with all the big moves and the changes, and we are already grooving in the first batch of changes we made. Sales seem to work quite well. We are grooving in. And then within two years, I would say we are ready to scale.
Let me ask you the other Decoder question I ask everybody. This is a big decision. How do you make decisions? What’s your framework for making decisions?
The first thing about decisions is empowerment. Don’t pull every decision up to the boardroom. It makes us slow. It is really not attracting people. People want to really make decisions on a lower level. So basic ideas, deciding on the lowest possible level. However, empowerment is not anarchy. If you have a clear strategy with those set boundaries, this is where I want to go. Within that frame, within your responsibility, you can act and are empowered. Empowered is a two-way street as well. Empowerment gives freedom, but it also requires accountability. So if you empower somebody, they have to be accountable for what the people are doing, which is super important. This is the first thing. So don’t decide on things that you can decide on a lower level.
But then, if it comes to, let’s say, the bigger rocks, the M&A decisions, this really goes into a very … I mean, we have processes, how we do it. We had a “P” proposal, which is a proposal where somebody says, “This is a company I want to acquire. This is my business case.” Outside in, in order to say, “Okay, now we believe in that.” You give your trigger, you already know how to negotiate, go forward, and make a non-binding offer. And then they work on it. We have a lot of processes, and when it comes up, we call it an “I” proposal where we finally pull the trigger to say, “Now you can invest, and you can go.”
And the decisions are, when it comes to strategies, engaging as many people as we can, the experts, listening to them in the boardroom. In some cases, we also ask them not to prepare a super-polished PowerPoint. That’s not the point. We want to really get the content. And then we have a very open discussion culture in our management board with our leaders to make better decisions. Very often, I’m also snorkeling around. We are getting advice from others, pulling our network if it comes to certain decisions. But I would say it’s a structured process, but it’s a process which encourages people to speak up, to bring their opinion in order to come to better decisions.
Let me ask one more question here, then I want to talk about the state of the world, and I really do want to talk about how you see AI and digital twins fitting into automation, because there’s a lot there.
Let’s say I’m a Siemens engineer working on low voltage switch gear. I’m one of 35,000 people in India, and I’m like, the CEO’s at CES talking about fabrics with [Nvidia CEO] Jensen Huang on stage, and we’re in the middle of a two-year transformation … But I just need to get my work done, and this is all just some corporate strategy distraction. How do you bring those two things together? Because this is the thing that kills projects at big companies. It kills them dead. And the number of times I’ve heard that story is very high. So how do you bring that together?
I know. There’s the first one, and this is so super important for communication because, and you got it right, low voltage. This is as mechanical as it can get. This is mechanical stuff, so it’s no software, no KEI, if not in the development, of course. But normally, this is a product that is hardware. Not only because we have now solid state switching, which is disruptive, which brings software into it, but take that aside. And then talking about being on stage, talking about KEI, new models, and digital twins, the people sometimes feel lost. Push is always talking about that stuff, but I’m just doing mechanicals. So we have to give love to these guys as well because they do a lot in terms of contributing to top and bottom line cash flow to our company. They are part of the equation.
If you go to any kind of customer, they say, “I love your automation. I love your software, but still I have to do some switching here,” and we are rolling in. And it’s super relevant because if you don’t have a switch or if it breaks, then you have a problem. So they bring the capabilities to a customer and say — we also have some low voltage here — but really say, “This is important for you to have a very solid operation.” It makes sense, and they are proud to contribute. So you have to distribute your love not only to the new stuff, but also to those that are basically super important and carry our P&L forward. And then the other element is, believe it or not, this CES presentation or keynote where you really are on par with … I mean, Jensen’s there, Satya [Nadella, Microsoft CEO] is there, and you show what we do and people … Even the low voltage guys are proud of what we do.
I’ll give a last one because I have to share it with you. We didn’t talk about a completely different area, which is mobility, Siemens Mobility. They do trains. This is hard stuff, boogies, frames, mechanical. These trains are super loaded with automation. These are basically software-defined trains because they tell you whatever … Even before they come to the depot, they tell the depot what they need, which part, what’s wrong, and how to replace it. So it’s technology at its best. However, which company can say that we are transforming the whole economy of 110 million people in a country, which is Egypt? It’s where we built 2,000 kilometers of railway lines from the north to the south, west to the east, connecting 90 million people and transforming the whole system with high-speed commuters and locomotives. This makes people proud, and I didn’t mention any AI technology, even though it’s in our trains, but this is something where we could say, “Who? Which and who? Which company in the world can do that?”
I’m very curious about all of that. I think there’s some amount of, you said, software-defined low voltage switches or software on the trains. Those worlds are colliding. I want to ask broadly just about the landscape you’re operating in to do all of that work. These are big opportunities at work. If you want to sell trains, you need to be a global company. You can’t be a single country train supplier. You have to operate everywhere.
I look at Siemens and its size and its history, and I say, “Okay, this company took advantage of globalization and free trade.” You’re in all these countries around the world, you’ve got tens of thousands of people all over the place, you’re building products all over the place, you’re taking advantage of the opportunities and the markets you’re in, the talent that’s in those markets.
And then I look up, and I read the newspaper, and the walls are going up around the world, everywhere, every single day. The Trump administration seems intent on putting ever-higher walls between the US and Europe, in particular, which seems very confusing to me. Other countries are nationalists in other ways. How are you thinking about Siemens in that moment, where a company that was able to grow and be such a large provider to so many people because of free trade and globalization, now has to contend with ever-higher walls and barriers between countries?
Obviously, we believe in free trade more than trade barriers because it brought the world to where we are, and leveraging all technology as fast as possible means bringing it to different countries as fast as possible. The good news about it is, and I mentioned our footprint before, since we are global from the very beginning… By the way, when Werner von Siemens founded this company 175 years or more ago, he sent one brother to London and one to Russia because he knew Germany was too small for his technology to scale. Ever since, Siemens has been a global company. And now our local for local content in the United States or China is 85 percent, 87 percent. So that means we are so local, and we have goods traveling from different places. So the impact on tariffs currently, and we said it last year, it’s a public figure, in 2025 last fiscal year was a low, mid-single-digit bottom-line impact.
Okay, that’s good for us. It’s maybe not good for others. Our customers are suffering, and with our customers, we are suffering, obviously. We know that machine builders have a reduced volume because their machines are tariffed when they go to the United States. Along with that, normally comes a Siemens Automation, so we see that, but the direct impact is rather low. It’s a second impact. And we are increasing our resilience as we speak. As it comes to certain semiconductors, we are trying to double source as much as possible, which we didn’t do before, in order to scale. We are looking for more localization to invest in the United States. We doubled our capacity for low voltage, medium voltage switching. We invested in assembly lines for trains. Investing in the United States. We are investing in India and China because that is one of our largest markets. Therefore, the good news is that we are quite resilient. Bad news is that for many, many of our customers, it doesn’t help, and it somehow slows down.
When you talk about investing in manufacturing in the United States, I’ve watched a lot of companies say a lot of things about investing in manufacturing in the United States. I’m from Racine, Wisconsin. I watched Foxconn insist that it was going to build an LCD factory in Racine, Wisconsin, and then simply not do that. And I watched Tim Cook reopen a factory that was already making Macs, so Donald Trump, in his first term, could say that Apple was opening a factory. There is a lot of theater about manufacturing in the United States, and then there’s the reality of investing for the long term when presidents come and go. How are you balancing that? Is it theater? Is it real investment? What is the split?
So the truth is, it’s a little bit of both. Where it’s real, let’s talk about the pharmaceutical industry. This is real investment. The Swiss ones, the German ones, are investing in pharmaceutical production in the United States. Some car makers that are not that strong, do that. But the big wave of remanufacturing in the United States is not happening yet. We don’t see that. And the reason is, maybe you mentioned it, number one, is the availability of people, also trained people. It is that you don’t know yet where the whole tariff situation will settle at the end of the day. The other reason is, why are we in a world that looks this way? It’s because American companies, in particular, were basically leveraging low labor costs and low costs in other countries, and they made a good living out of it. And you mentioned some of them as well. So do I believe that this will change? Yes. I believe there will be a wave, and we do see more manufacturing coming.
And I didn’t mention semiconductors. Definitely, this is a hard fact. Semiconductor builds. Maybe even battery factories would come, pharmaceuticals, and the like. The only point I always advise our customers is that if you build a new manufacturing line in the United States, make it as automated and as digital as possible for obvious reasons, because you cannot get enough labor, let alone trained labor. And technology is there. So if you go there with a greenfield planned, you have all the freedoms to make this whole thing digital before even sending the first excavation machine. Your products, digitalizing your manufacturing, simulate everything. That’s what we do, by the way. Whenever we build a new one, we go all in. And then you build it. It’s faster. You don’t make mistakes in building. It increases your space productivity and reduces your energy consumption. It increases your output while having more variables and more variants of your products. So that will come, but we thought it would come faster; it seems there’s a delay in really ramping up manufacturing in the United States. And again, maybe sector by sector, you’ll see different patterns.
Do you think that’s because people assume that there will be a snap back to normal trade relations in the world, or do you think it’s just slow?
The latter one. I don’t believe these tariffs will just snap back. Why? Tariffs, more or less, are like taxes, and they help close the budget deficit. And I never saw taxes going back. I hope that this may come to more normal terms. For example, our machines, which are exported to the United States, suffer from tariffs, but they also face these tariffs on aluminum and steel on top of that, which makes them quite expensive. So maybe that goes away. There might be some adoptions, which I think will come, but I don’t believe that this goes back to where we came from.
Look, I have a rudimentary understanding of economics.
You are doing well.
I studied this as an undergraduate at the University of Chicago 20 years ago. My understanding of all this is that this is how you equalize labor rates. You say, “Okay, you can make the products cheaper overseas. We’ll just put a tariff on top of it. Now the product is as expensive as making it in the United States, so you might as well make it here.” And that is bluntly what the Trump administration is haphazardly trying to convey. But what you’re saying is, “We’re Siemens. We make automation. We can virtually model the entire factory as a digital twin before you build it. In AI, we can automate even more. We can automate people using Excel to program your factory. Just build that.” And I look at that, and I say, “Well, that didn’t get anybody a job.” I look at data center investment in the United States, and communities around the United States are pushing back on data centers because they’re like, “This is a lot to extract from the environment and from our land, and not enough jobs.” And I see that same argument being applied to fully automated factories.
Yes.
How do you push back against that? Is a fully automated factory a net addition to the economy, do you think?
It’s a net-add with fewer people per output, if you don’t automate. Absolutely. That’s absolutely clear. The point is, we are living in aging societies. Germany, Japan, Korea, and China are aging. There’s a really steep curve. So sooner or later, you will see that creating jobs like crazy is maybe not the point because you’re missing jobs anyhow, or labor anyhow. You might want to deploy the labor you have in jobs that you cannot replace. The social system, the healthcare system, and the like, use labor really where it makes a difference. And in manufacturing, you have less and less. This is changing. You still have people on our shop floor, but you will have fewer. And you said it right, an AI factory fully automated, this uses a lot of space, uses a lot of energy, and it creates a limited number of jobs. That’s what an AI factory is. Yeah.
Who buys the outputs of an AI factory?
The tokens. Intelligence.
I’m just saying, if I build a fully automated factory to make cars, but no one has a job, who buys the cars?
Again, as I said before, what you do when you have full auto manufacturing, you’re driving the economy, you grow faster. You can bring the production to the United States, which has value in it. And once the economy is growing, obviously, your GDP per capita is increasing, and people are going to buy cars, but they have a different deployment.
But where do they get the money? Again, a rudimentary understanding of economics.
So number one is you’re replacing blue collar workers with more trained workers, with engineers, maybe also blue collar workers using AI technology. So a factory doesn’t run without… Again, we have higher output with fewer people, but you still have … I mean, I talked about it, the whole service sector is super relevant, and they’re missing people as well. Germany, for example, I can share about that. If we do not have hundreds of thousands of immigrants, and most of them working in service jobs, including hospitals and the like… If I take them out of the equation, our whole healthcare system would collapse. So there are a lot of jobs that you cannot replace. And that’s one more thing. When people ask me what to study, I say, “Okay, a solid education in mathematics or physics is always good, but if you don’t really feel like it, you can go for a plumbing job or a handicraft job, because that is the last job to be replaced.”
Yeah. The world needs electricians and plumbers for sure. That much I understand. Someone’s got to build and plumb the data centers, and maybe that’s the only career in the future. So your vision is like a fully automated factory. You’re talking about the higher-order jobs, like information jobs, technology jobs, and engineering jobs. I would call those software jobs. In some broad categorization, there’s some amount of white-collar work that has a laptop involved. That’s the next thing you could automate with AI. And you’ve made some gestures at that, right? We can automate even more of the things.
Yeah.
As I mentioned earlier, it seems like a lot of the frame for how you’re thinking is, Siemens has traditionally automated atoms, now you can automate bits.
Yes.
And I see so much excitement about AI automating bits. How are you thinking about that, moving up from, okay, you’ve decided how many units to produce, we’ll produce them, to we’re going to actually automate the deciding of how many units to produce?
And this goes really deep because… And this is when we talk about this industrial operating system, an AI-based operating system, where you really talk about this manufacturing line, which is finally … Running autonomously is a big word, but we are getting closer and closer to doing that. And here comes the point. Number one, it obviously starts with — and I’ll come to manufacturing in a second — but it starts with the design of your product. You create a digital twin of your product, and you simulate how it runs on a manufacturing line. And this loop of producing and simulating and producing your products, which you already have in the digital world, is so powerful. Because whenever you make a change, a component, maybe you want to be more resilient when designing another component, you go all the way back to your design drawings, you change it, and you know which part of manufacturing is impacted. So that’s very powerful.
But let me speak on the manufacturing line itself. The whole idea is that you start building this operating system, which is a layered system. Obviously, you need to get all the data that your manufacturing line produces. You have to connect to all your machines, the status of your machines, enrich them with environmental data, as you want to get the real-time data, even the drawing data of your machines as well, because once you have that, and you simulate it … And this is what we call the digital twin composer. That means you’re sucking in different digital twins of a machine, of a line, of a product; you suck it in, and then you have a complete, comprehensive digital twin which ingests real-time data. Then you can go forward and backward in time, and you can find out what the problem is.
And then here comes the real one, when you close the loop of ingesting data but sending data back to the line, which is then the agent, which behaves on behalf of you. An agent is like a trained supervisor for a line. So when a red light is blinking, a supervisor goes there, looks at it, and says, “Oh yeah, this is a problem. I know that, over and over again, this is what I have to do.” And this is what AI agents can do. Finally, you still need somebody who is removing a blockage, changing, or updating. Maybe updating the software will be automatic, but changing a part, changing a piece, or having a switch where something is going wrong, you need people who know what to do. We tell them what to do with glasses. I also presented it at CES.
So this helps you interact in your natural words and helps you fix things, even if you don’t know all the details. This is where agents come in, or orchestration agents, which are supported by a machine building agent, a machine agent, a product agent, a workflow agent, whatever. And that’s how the future looks, which is very powerful. It keeps your yield high, your quality process very high, and you’re super agile if there’s any change or change in your production because you have a different version you want to produce. It’s super smart, and it doesn’t take a week to reassemble your line, but it really goes automatically.
When you talk about industrial agents… So there are some lines, something’s gone wrong, a warning light goes off, and you say an agent will help you figure out what’s wrong and potentially fix it by itself. Is that based on an LLM? Are you using one of the models from one of the big companies, and it’s just an LLM that you’ve trained to think about a line in that way?
Yep, but not only that. It’s based on an LLM, different ones, depending on which one we are working on and different use cases, but it’s based on an LLM, but it’s not good enough. If you only use an LLM or an LLM-based agent to fix a problem, the hit rate is near what we need, but we are training these LLMs on our data, on proprietary data, product data, machine data, and operation data. Once you have that, and even the data of fixes in the past … Remember, when you’d walk a [manufacturing] plant, and you’d see the whiteboard where a supervisor writes, “I have a problem here, this is who is working on it, and here I fixed it.” All that knowledge goes into this model so that you just say, “Okay, this is the pattern of a problem. This is what the fix was.” The model knows it because we upload the data.
So it’s a model that is trained. This is why we talk about an industrial AI model, which is trained on industrial data. Fundamental, if it really runs across, but also very specific, if it comes to certain machines, then the hit rate goes up from 60 percent, 70 percent, to the 95-ish/8-ish plus, which is really what you can do then.
Are these your models that you’re training, or are you augmenting models you’re taking?
We are augmenting. We don’t do LLMs, so really large models that are trained on the whole of knowledge in the world. This we don’t do [in house]. This is what we’re using any kind of, for specific tasks. We have some models which are very good in software, copilots, and agents for software. And now we are working on really genuine and new product designs, not only just having the next code line, but really genuine designs, a completely different world. And in some cases, we’re working on copilots on the shop floor. We talk about Microsoft, for example, and we are having the first use cases doing that. So, challenges, of course, are that an industrial AI application doesn’t accept hallucination. You really have to be sure that once you send an agent out, it does what you want it to do.
This is my fundamental question, and I’ve asked a lot of people this. I’m very curious about your perspective, because the domain is so different. I am not convinced that LLM technology, as it exists today, can make the leap to do all of the things that people want it to do. You see the gaps. Even as you’re saying, an LLM on its own hallucinates enough to only be effective 60 percent to 70 percent of the time. That’s nowhere near good enough for all of the things people want it to do — especially at the labor replacement rates that some of these folks talk about. Do you think it’s good enough, or do you think it’s the actual augmentation that makes it, the products that you build with it, good?
They need the augmentation, absolutely.
And actually, I’m also going to ask the second part of that question. Do you see LLM technology, the core technology, improving at a rate that might change your assessment of it?
Good point. To the question, LLMs will get better and better, but I don’t believe that these LLMs, if you do not train them really on specific industrial data, and this is where the augmentation comes from… You can train them as well, and as long as we want, but they will not get to the level that we can use on the shop floor. It will not work. I strongly believe that the LLMs need specific, domain-specific, machine-specific data in order to really make a difference. But then, if you do that, then you really can make a step up, which is fundamentally higher. I can give you two examples, which are maybe interesting. One is an optical inspection task where we used an LLM and said, “Okay, show me the problem.” Hit rate was okay-ish, but not to the level we needed. Then we start training the model with not so much data, which is anyhow important because if you’re manufacturing at a PPM level, guess how many mistakes you get a day? But on those that you have made, you then create some synthetic data around those.
Once you train the model, your hit rate goes up substantially. It’s much, much higher than if you use the next best and next best models. Is there convergence? To some extent, I do believe there’s a certain ceiling where you can train as well as you want, but if you do not get specific training, then you have a problem. Now, my second example is, and now I will give you a little bit of the spirit of how deep you have to go… We have an Italian manufacturer, they make robots, a crib in the box, a crib in the box for any kind of parts. And obviously, you can train a robot to make this crib in a box. What we did was create this wholly in the digital world. We used a digital part with a digital arm, digital software, a digital camera, and maybe everything, and we trained a robot over and over again on this crib in the box with our technology. And then we switched it on, and the hit rate was still not satisfying, 70-odd level.
It’s amazing now because we trained for hundreds of hours virtually. Then we used Nvidia technology with a photorealistic ray tracing of these pieces, photorealistic ray tracing at different lights, and trained the model over again. The hit rate was jumping up substantially. So these little details of having a normal representation of a digital part and a really photorealistic one made the hit rate come up substantially. And this is also the reason why when you train robots now in the virtual world, it doesn’t really work. There’s a reason we have so many people who are standing there with some handles and training robots to do a job and train over and over and over again, because this is real training on the real stuff. And these little details make a difference between an industrial application and one that you cannot use. What I’m saying is that training models on specific data, on valuable design data, operation data, and time series data, brings them to the level that we need in order to deploy them.
All that data has to come from lots of different customers, and you talk about Siemens as having all that data. But that data actually belongs to your customers. Are they willing to let you aggregate so that you can develop the products at the scale that you’re talking about?
So don’t underestimate the amount of data we have. I talk about generations of design data for controls, for trains, for switches, and whatnot, number one. Number two is that we have, I don’t know, how many thousands of machines we are operating. We have machines, we have machine jobs, machining jobs. But if we then go to my AI guys, they say, “Okay, you make everything available now from Siemens?” Then they say, “Ah, still not enough.” They need so much data to train models. Now we have an alliance for machine builders, German machine builders, nine of them. I mean top, top, top. These are the names, Trumpf, DMG Mori, and the like; they are ready now to share their data with us to train models, to bring them a model that they can use to make an application that makes their machines run autonomously.
So you just say, “This is the part, here’s the machine, and just get going.” They know that their data is not very useful because it’s too little, but if you add up, if you create these data alliances, it works. It requires a certain trust. This is again where Siemens comes in because they trust us. We have been partners for decades now. We are very mindful of that one. So you’re right, you need as much data as possible. You need as much proprietary data as possible. Would they share the data of their absolute latest machine with us? No, but don’t need that. It can use all the other ones, which is absolutely helpful.
Let me wrap up with just a big picture question here. I’m just thinking about Siemens as a company and what it represents, and all the places it is around the world, and the value of this scale. You have 320,000 people in all the places around the world. And then I just think about the barriers going up. And Siemens is a defense contractor for both the United States government and Europe, and a bunch of other countries around the world. Are you planning for an event as catastrophic as the dissolution of NATO? It’s great to be like, we can aggregate all the data from all our customers, but also the world might fall apart. Are you thinking about Siemens as a global company in that context?
Yes, we do. If you ask me, do we make a kind of scenario planning of another war or whatever, some incident in Taiwan, we don’t really, because I told my people we cannot do that over and over again. It comes in different forms. So, therefore, why would you? Stay agile and be really fast if something happens. So this is one thing. On the other side, we see obviously the trends in the world, and we are working more and more on what we call the forging of technologies. So, local for local, that you do not always rely on certain technologies from the United States used in China for China and the United States, or for Europe. So it’s a pity because normally you would like to scale, and we still have core technologies which we can multiply, but obviously, getting … For example, we are training our industrial AI applications for China on Chinese LLMs, whereas for the United States, obviously, we train them on American hyperscalers or whatever, LLMs.
So we have good experiences also, and this makes us more resilient. Can I do that for everything? Can I fork all my software? I could, but it’s just prohibitively expensive; it doesn’t make sense. But for certain areas, we do that and increase our resilience and hope for the best.
I realize I’m ending on a down note here, but it just seems like so much of what you’re excited about is the opportunity of scale, the opportunity to do these things cooperatively, in a way that maybe changes the world economy, and all of us are just caring for robots in the end. But these are huge global ideas that you have, and I’m just trying to put them in the context of, boy, when I hear other people talk about AI, it is in the context of national champions and international competition in a way that feels very old. 
It does not feel like the world of the past 20 years. This feels like a return to a different time. And I’m just wondering how you can keep the optimism of the scale and the globalization when that is happening all around you.
Maybe I have this optimism because I’m working in one of the most international companies in the world. We are a Chinese company, as we are a United States company and a European one, and we have so many great people all around the world. And I’ll also see how they are collaborating, and I believe that this is a core value of societies, which is super, super relevant for the future. There might be times where this is not appreciated so much for whatever reason, but in the long run, I believe that a world which is using technologies in order to solve the real problems in the world … We have to feed 10 billion people now. We are creating our climate and whatnot. And we have aging societies where healthcare is a huge problem. So we cannot solve it if we box ourselves too small, so scale it. And here I hope that when we have waves of opening and closing and whatnot, that ultimately this pays out if you are acting in a global international network as we do, and therefore I’m more optimistic.
What should we be looking for next from Siemens?
I think the next thing is that we are walking the talk. We talk about that we are building this industrial AI operating system, that we are using AI now for the next level to really not only validate, but also create, that we are leveraging our capabilities of bringing the real world and the digital world together, because the digital world can do so much if you do not have an impact on the real world. We show that with our customers, like PepsiCo, which was showing at CES, like Kyron, the supply chain or logistics company, or many, many others. And to see that we can be the entry door for AI technology into the real world together with our partners at scale.
Roland, this has been great. I could do another full hour just on the structure of Siemens. I think, as you can tell.
I know. I know.
You’re going to have to come back. Thank you so much for being on Decoder.
Nilay, thank you.

The stream will take place on February 12 at 5PM ET. It will run for over an hour and feature PlayStation Studios titles as well as third-party projects and indie games that are bound for PS5. You can watch it on PlayStation’s official YouTube channel (in English, Japanese or with English subtitles) or on Twitch.
As the first State of Play of the year, Sony is going to want to drum up some more hype for its upcoming release slate. Since Bungie’s Marathon is due to arrive on March 5, that will surely make an appearance. MLB The Show 26, which is out on March 17, will likely get a look in too. We could also get another peek at Saros, the highly anticipated follow-up to Housemarque’s Returnal, which will arrive on March 20. A new trailer for Marvel’s Wolverine isn’t out of the question, but Sony could wait until a summer showcase to give us another look at that one. 

The last State of Play took place in November, but that one was focused solely on games coming out of Asia and Japan. Before that, Sony also had a showcase during Tokyo Game Show in September, which featured a first look at gameplay from the aforementioned Wolverine, which is due to arrive later in 2026.

The two countries join over 110 territories worldwide that already offer HBO Max. Some HBO shows, like Euphoria, have already been available in these regions through other platforms. HBO Max will bring titles like The Pitt, One Battle After Another and Sinners. It will also air the upcoming Harry Potter series. 
An HBO Max subscription will be available in the UK and Ireland starting on Thursday, March 26. Plans will start at Basic with Ads for £5 per month, offering all titles except movies that first stream on HBO Max after a theatrical release. Then there's Standard with Ads for £6 per month, which includes those releases and 30 downloads. Both can stream on two devices at a time. 

Anyone who wants an ad-free experience can purchase a Standard or Premium plan. The former has all titles available on two devices, up to 30 downloads and, of course, no ads. The Premium plan comes with four devices in 4K Ultra HD with Dolby Atmos — if the system has capabilities. 
Interestingly, the expanded area comes as Netflix prepares to own Warner Bros., including HBO and HBO Max. While there's no indication of whether this had any influence, Netflix has long been available in the UK and Ireland.
